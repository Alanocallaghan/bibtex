  abstract = {Phloroglucinol is a valuable chemical which has been successfully produced by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. However, the low productivity remains a bottleneck for large-scale application and cost-effective production. In the present work, we cloned the key biosynthetic gene, phlD (a type III polyketide synthase), into a bacterial expression vector to produce phloroglucinol in E. coli and developed different strategies to re-engineer the recombinant strain for robust synthesis of phloroglucinol. Overexpression of E. coli marA (multiple antibiotic resistance) gene enhanced phloroglucinol resistance and elevated phloroglucinol production to 0.27 g/g dry cell weight. Augmentation of the intracellular malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) level through coordinated expression of four acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) subunits increased phloroglucinol production to around 0.27 g/g dry cell weight. Furthermore, the coexpression of ACCase and marA caused another marked improvement in phloroglucinol production 0.45 g/g dry cell weight, that is, 3.3-fold to the original strain. Under fed-batch conditions, this finally engineered strain accumulated phloroglucinol up to 3.8 g/L in the culture 12 h after induction, corresponding to a volumetric productivity of 0.32 g/L/h. This result was the highest phloroglucinol production to date and showed promising to make the bioprocess economically feasible.},

  abstract = {Phlorotannins of brown algae are multifunctional compounds with putative roles in herbivore deterrence, antioxidation and as primary cell wall components. Due to their peripheral localization and absorption at short wavelengths, a photoprotective role is suggested. We examined the induction of phlorotannins by artificial UV radiation in the intertidal kelp Lessonia nigrescens and whether they attenuate the inhibition of photosynthesis and DNA damage, two major detrimental effects of UV. The soluble and cell wall-bound fractions of phlorotannins were quantified in blades collected in summer and winter. Major findings were that (1) the synthesis of phlorotannins (both forms) was induced by UV only in summer; (2) the induction was fast (within 3\hspace{1em}days); and (3) there was a positive relationship between of the contents of insoluble phlorotannins and the suppression of photoinhibition and DNA damage, measured as formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts. Overall, the photoprotective role of phlorotannins appears to respond to an interplay between the external UV stimulus, seasonal acclimation and intrinsic morpho-functional processes. In summer, when algae are naturally exposed to high UV irradiances, soluble phlorotannins are induced, while their transition to insoluble phlorotannins could be related with the growth requirements, as active blade elongation occurs during this season.},

  abstract = {Exposure to ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation has been associated with a variety of adverse effects in all forms of life, including micro-organisms, plants, animals and humans. Ultraviolet B induces cell damage at the molecular level and consequently organisms must employ strategies to protect themselves from sunlight and to repair UV-B-induced cellular damage. In this study, the UV-B protective effects of four different phlorotannins isolated from a brown alga (Ecklonia cava) were determined using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an in vivo model. Zebrafish embryos were pretreated with phlorotannins and exposed to UV-B (50 mJ/cm(2)). The heart rate, generation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, cell death and hyperpigmentation were assessed in order to evaluate UV-B-induced photo-damage. Treatment of the embryos with the algal phorotannins reduced UV-B-induced reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide levels, protected against UV-B-induced cell death and significantly reduced hyperpigmentation. We therefore suggest that phlorotannins isolated from E. cava can protect against UV-B radiation. Editor Note. Readers of the journal may be unfamiliar with the use of zebrafish embryos in research studies. There is no indication in this article of an ethical review of the study. This is because the use of fish embryos in research, at least in the UK, is not subject to a licensing procedure if they are less than 5 days post fertilization (dpf). In this study the embryos were 2 dpf.},

Ethanol extract showed the strongest ACE inhibitory activity with an IC(50) value of 0.96 mg/ml. Five kinds of phlorotannins, phloroglucinol, triphlorethol-A, eckol, dieckol, and eckstolonol, were isolated from ethanol extract of E. cava, which exhibited potential ACE inhibition. Dieckol was the most potent ACE inhibitor and was found to be a non-competitive inhibitor against ACE according to Lineweaver-Burk plots. Dieckol had an inducible effect on the production of NO in EAhy926 cells without having cytotoxic effect. The results of this study indicate that E. cava could be a potential source of phlorotannins with ACE inhibitory activity for utilization in production of functional foods.},

As a result, eckol reduced H(2)O(2) induced cell death in V79-4 cells. In addition, eckol inhibited cell damage induced by serum starvation and radiation by scavenging ROS. Eckol was found to increase the activity of catalase and its protein expression. Further, molecular mechanistic study revealed that eckol increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and activity of nuclear factor kappa B. Taken together, the results suggest that eckol protects V79-4 cells against oxidative damage by enhancing the cellular antioxidant activity and modulating cellular signal pathway.},

Zebrafish embryos were exposed to AAPH and compared with other groups that were co-exposed with phlorotannins until 2-days post-fertilisation. All phlorotannins scavenged intracellular ROS and prevented lipid peroxidation and reduced AAPH-induced cell death in zebrafish embryos. Negative changes in morphological phenomena, such as pericardial oedema, yolk sac oedema, and growth retardation in zebrafish embryos exposed to AAPH were not observed in groups exposed to phlorotannins. These results clearly indicate that phlorotannins possess prominent antioxidant activity against AAPH-mediated toxicity and might be potential therapeutic agents for treating or preventing several diseases implicated with oxidative stress.

The effect on melanogenesis was evaluated via the inhibitory effects of tyrosinase and melanin synthesis. Among the phlorotannins, dieckol showed higher effect than that of the other phlorotannins in the both assays; especially the value of dieckol in the tyrosinase inhibition assay was relatively higher than that of a commercial tyrosinase inhibitor (kojic acid). The UV-B protection effect was evaluated via DCFH-DA, MTT, comet assays, and morphological changes in fibroblast. Intracellular ROS induced by UV-B radiation was reduced by the addition of phlorotannins and cell viability was dose-dependently increased. Moreover, dieckol demonstrated strong protective properties against UV-B radiation-induced DNA damage via damaged tail intensity and morphological changes in fibroblast. Hence, these results indicated that dieckol isolated from E. cava has potential whitening effects and prominent protective effects on UV-B radiation-induced cell damages, which might be used in pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries.},

After administration of 5 and 25mg/kg mouse of DRP and 4 g/kg mice ethanol, the body weights and survival rates were increased as compared to the control, which is ethanol-treated group without DRP. The glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase levels in the serum were lower than those of the control. DRP exhibited a reduction of the total cholesterol. The lower levels of SOD enzyme and a reduction of the formation of malondialdehyde were occurred in mice fed with 5 and 25mg/kg mouse of DRP. Finally the effect on improvement of fatty liver induced by ethanol was observed by taking out the liver immediately after dissecting the mouse. However, no significant difference was observed on hepatic histopathological changes. In conclusion, this study indicated that DRP could protect liver injury induced by ethanol in vivo. It suggested that DRP possesses the beneficial effect to human against ethanol-induced liver injury.},

These experiments were done in order to determine whether indoxylacetate could be an adequate chromogenic reactant for AChE assay evaluation. Moreover, the results were compared to the standard Ellman's method. We calculated Michaelis constant Km (2.06 \texttimes{} 10(-4) mol/L for acetylthiocholine and 3.21 \texttimes{} 10(-3) mol/L for indoxylacetate) maximum reaction velocity V(max) (4.97 \texttimes{} 10(-7) kat for acetylcholine and 7.71 \texttimes{} 10(-8) kat for indoxylacetate) for electric eel AChE. In a second part, inhibition values were plotted for paraoxon, and reactivation efficacy was measured for some standard oxime reactivators: obidoxime, pralidoxime (2-PAM) and HI-6. Though indoxylacetate is split with lower turnover rate, this compound appears as a very attractive reactant since it does not show any chemical reactivity with oxime antidots and thiol used for the Ellman's method. Thus it can be advantageously used for accurate measurement of AChE activity. Suitability of assay for butyrylcholinesterase activity assessment is also discussed.},

One assay is based on binding of fluorescence-tagged Abeta\{1-42\} to synthetic Abeta\{1-42\} plated in wells of fluorescent black-wall microplates. Fluorescence-tagged Abeta\{1-42\} solutions with and without blockers are then added to the plates, and the amount of bound fluorescence is measured. Another is a tissue type assay, where sections of unfixed AD or AD model transgenic mouse brains are mounted on glass slides. The same solutions assayed in the microplate test are then added to tissue sections. Binding of fluorescence-tagged Abeta\{1-42\} to the Abeta deposits in AD or transgenic brain tissue is detected with a fluorescence microscope. Good agreement is obtained between the two methods. Most of the tested agents have too low an affinity for Abeta \{1-42\} to be effective clinically. Agents that may have marginal affinity according to these tests include 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-b-D-glucopyranose (PGG), S-diclofenac, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, and extracts of spirulina, ginger, rhubarb, cinnamon, blueberries, and turmeric. Compounds which failed to show binding include scyllo-inositol, myo-inositol, rhamnose, ginkgolide A, emodin, rhein, caryophellene, curcumin, valproic acid, tramiprosate, and garlic extract.},

Small-molecule chemical probes are crucial for dissecting these highly organized interactions, for mapping their function at the molecular level and developing new therapeutics. The lack of ideal chemical probes required to understand macromolecular interactions is the missing link in the next step of dissecting such interactions. Unfortunately, the classical combinatorial-chemistry community has not successfully provided the required probes (i.e. natural product inspired chemical probes that are rich in stereochemical and three-dimensional structural diversity) to achieve these goals. The emerging area of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) is beginning to provide natural product-like chemical probes that may be useful in this arena.},

  abstract = {This review is an updated and expanded version of two prior reviews that were published in this journal in 1997 and 2003. In the case of all approved agents the time frame has been extended to include the 251/2 years from 01/1981 to 06/2006 for all diseases worldwide and from 1950 (earliest so far identified) to 06/2006 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwide. We have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a "natural product mimic" or "NM" to join the original primary divisions. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the final drug entity, is still alive and well. Thus, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from around the 1940s to date, of the 155 small molecules, 73\% are other than "S" (synthetic), with 47\% actually being either natural products or directly derived therefrom. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked, with, as expected from prior information, the antiinfective area being dependent on natural products and their structures. Although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have, in fact, been used in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are able to identify only one de novo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this 25 plus year time frame. We wish to draw the attention of readers to the rapidly evolving recognition that a significant number of natural product drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or microbial interactions with the "host from whence it was isolated", and therefore we consider that this area of natural product research should be expanded significantly.},

The analgesic efficacy of ziconotide likely results from its ability to interrupt pain signaling at the level of the spinal cord. Ziconotide is a peptidic drug and has been approved for the treatment of severe chronic pain in patients only when administered by the intrathecal route. Importantly, prolonged administration of ziconotide does not lead to the development of addiction or tolerance. The current review discusses the various studies that have addressed the in vitro biochemical and electrophysiological actions of ziconotide as well as the numerous pre-clinical studies that were conducted to elucidate its antinociceptive mechanism of action in animals. In addition, this review considers the pivotal Phase 3 (and other) clinical trials that were conducted in support of ziconotide's approval for the treatment of severe chronic pain and tries to offer some insights regarding the future discovery and development of newer analgesic drugs that would act by a similar mechanism to ziconotide but which might offer improved safety, tolerability and ease of use.},

  abstract = {In this study, the phlorotannin dieckol, which was isolated from the brown alga Ecklonia cava, was examined for its inhibitory effects on melanin synthesis. Tyrosinase inhibitors are important agents for cosmetic products. We therefore examined the inhibitory effects of dieckol on mushroom tyrosinase and melanin synthesis, and analyzed its binding modes using the crystal structure of Bacillus megaterium tyrosinase (PDB ID: 3NM8). Dieckol inhibited mushroom tyrosinase with an IC(50) of 20{$\mu$}M and was more effective as a cellular tyrosinase having melanin reducing activities than the commercial inhibitor, arbutin, in B16F10 melanoma cells, and without apparent cytotoxicity. It was found that dieckol behaved as a non-competitive inhibitor with l-tyrosine substrates. For further insight, we predicted the 3D structure of tyrosinase and used a docking algorithm to simulate binding between tyrosinase and dieckol. These molecular modeling studies were successful (calculated binding energy value: -126.12kcal/mol), and indicated that dieckol interacts with His208, Met215, and Gly46. These results suggest that dieckol has great potential to be further developed as a pharmaceutical or cosmetic agent for use in dermatological disorders associated with melanin.},

In addition, plausible protein-ligand interactions of 3, 4, and 5 were similar and may occur primarily through the TYR132 and THR133 of BACE1 via molecular docking simulations (autodock 4.0 and fred 2.0 programs). As a result, the E. bicyclis extract and the phlorotannins contained therein would clearly have beneficial use in the development of therapeutic and preventive agents for AD and suggest potential guidelines for the design of BACE-selective inhibitors.},

  abstract = {Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweed, displays a wide variety of internal biological activities; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fucoidan's anti-inflammatory activity remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of fucoidan on production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory mediators in BV2 microglia. Our data indicated that fucoidan treatment significantly inhibited excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E{$_{2}$} (PGE{$_{2}$}) in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. It also attenuated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{$\alpha$}. Moreover, fucoidan exhibited anti-inflammatory properties by suppression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) activation and down-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and AKT pathways. These finding suggest that fucoidan may offer substantial therapeutic potential for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases that are accompanied by microglial activation.},

  abstract = {A simple, automated test measuring the ferric reducing ability of plasma, the FRAP assay, is presented as a novel method for assessing "antioxidant power." Ferric to ferrous ion reduction at low pH causes a colored ferrous-tripyridyltriazine complex to form. FRAP values are obtained by comparing the absorbance change at 593 nm in test reaction mixtures with those containing ferrous ions in known concentration. Absorbance changes are linear over a wide concentration range with antioxidant mixtures, including plasma, and with solutions containing one antioxidant in purified form. There is no apparent interaction between antioxidants. Measured stoichiometric factors of Trolox, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and uric acid are all 2.0; that of bilirubin is 4.0. Activity of albumin is very low. Within- and between-run CVs are {$<$}1.0 and {$<$}3.0\%, respectively, at 100-1000 micromol/liter. FRAP values of fresh plasma of healthy Chinese adults: 612-1634 micromol/liter (mean, 1017; SD, 206; n = 141). The FRAP assay is inexpensive, reagents are simple to prepare, results are highly reproducible, and the procedure is straightforward and speedy. The FRAP assay offers a putative index of antioxidant, or reducing, potential of biological fluids within the technological reach of every laboratory and researcher interested in oxidative stress and its effects.},

Since the 1980s, several thousand studies concerning calixarenes and host-guest interactions have been published. Although there is growing interest in protein-calixarene interactions, only limited structural information has been available to date. We now report the crystal structure of a protein-calixarene complex. The water-soluble p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene is shown to bind the lysine-rich cytochrome c at three different sites. Binding curves obtained from NMR titrations reveal an interaction process that involves two or more binding sites. Together, the data indicate a dynamic complex in which the calixarene explores the surface of cytochrome c. In addition to providing valuable information on protein recognition, the data also indicate that the calixarene is a mediator of protein-protein interactions, with potential applications in generating assemblies and promoting crystallization.},

In the current study, we investigated the effects of the pheophytin a analog vitamin B(12) on PC12 cell differentiation. In the presence of a low level of nerve growth factor (10 ng ml(-1)), vitamin B(12 )demonstrated neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in PC12 cells. The effect was dose-dependent in the range of 6-100 muM. In the absence of nerve growth factor, vitamin B(12) did not promote differentiation. To investigate the mechanism for this effect, we conducted differentiation assays and western blot analysis with signal transduction inhibitors and found that vitamin B(12) did not promote PC12 cell differentiation in the presence of K252a or U0126 inhibitors. These results suggest that vitamin B(12 )stimulates PC12 cell differentiation through enhancement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway, which is also induced by nerve growth factor. Thus, vitamin B(12) may be a good candidate for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {Carotenoid intake has been associated with the decrease of the incidence of some chronic diseases by minimizing the in vivo oxidative damages induced by reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS). The carotenoids are well-known singlet oxygen quenchers; however, their capacity to scavenge other reactive species, such as peroxyl radical (ROO\textbullet{}), hydroxyl radical (HO\textbullet{}), hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and anion peroxynitrite (ONOO-), still needs to be more extensively studied, especially using membrane-mimicking systems, such as liposomes. Moreover, the identification of carotenoids possessing high antioxidant capacity can lead to new alternatives of drugs or nutritional supplements for prophylaxis or therapy of pathological conditions related to oxidative damages, such as cardiovascular diseases. The capacity to scavenge ROO\textbullet, HO\textbullet, HOCl and ONOO- of seven carotenoids found in marine organisms was determined in liposomes based on the fluorescence loss of a fluorescent lipid (C11-BODIPY581/591) due to its oxidation by these reactive species. The carotenoid-bearing hydroxyl groups were generally more potent ROS scavengers than the carotenes, whilst {$\beta$}-carotene was the most efficient ONOO- scavenger. The role of astaxanthin as an antioxidant should be highlighted, since it was a more potent scavenger of ROO\textbullet, HOCl and ONOO- than {$\alpha$}-tocopherol.},

  abstract = {Recently, the isolation and characterization of the biologically active components from seaweeds have gained much attention from various research groups across the world. The marine algae have been studied for biologically active components and phlorotannins are one among them. Among marine algae, brown algal species such as Ecklonia cava, Eisenia arborea, Ecklonia stolinifera and Eisenia bicyclis have been studied for their potential biological activities. Majority of the investigations on phlorotannins derived from brown algae have exhibited their potentiality as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antitumor, antihypertensive, anti-allergic, hyaluronidase enzyme inhibition and in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inhibition activity. In this review, we have made an attempt to discuss the potential biological activities of phlorotannins from marine brown algae and their possible candidature in the pharmaceutical applications.},

In this study, we attempted to characterize the neuroprotective effects of phlorotannins isolated from Ecklonia cava, including phloroglucinol, eckol, triphloroethol A, eckstolonol, and dieckol, against H(2)O(2)-induced cell damage in murine hippocampus neuronal (HT22) cells. We measured the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation levels and evaluated the resultant cell death and alterations in Ca(2+)-concentrations. All phlorotannins were to scavenge intracellular ROS and repress ROS accumulation, thus preventing lipid peroxidation. Consquently, all phlorotannins reduced H(2)O(2)-induced cell death in HT22 cells. Moreover, phlorotannins inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced Ca(2+) release. This study provides a new useful strategy for preventing neuronal H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress.},

And fucose was the predominant monosaccharide in WPS-1 and WPS-2, accounting for 46.91\% and 45.1\%, respectively. Antioxidant activity tests revealed that WPS-2 showed significant function of scavenging hydroxyl free radical and WPS-1 exhibited the highest inhibitory effects on superoxide radical. Cytotoxicity of all polysaccharide fractions was evaluated by MTT assay and Hoechst 33258 staining. Results showed that WPS-1 and WPS-2 significantly inhibited the growth of A375 cells and low anti-proliferative effects of WPS-2 on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were observed. These results suggested that the polysaccharide fraction of WPS-2 might be explored as a potential safe antioxidant and antitumor agent.},

Furthermore, fucoidan reversed the decreased activity of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and content of acetylcholine (Ach), as well as the increased activity of acetylcholine esterase (AchE) and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in hippocampal tissue of A{$\beta$}-injected rats. Moreover, these were accompanied by an increase of Bcl-2/Bax ratio and a decrease of caspase-3 activity. These results suggested that fucoidan could ameliorate the learning and memory abilities in A{$\beta$}-induced AD rats, and the mechanisms appeared to be due to regulating the cholinergic system, reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting the cell apoptosis.},

Also, extracts of N. aculeata inhibited H2O2-induced lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates. The properties of the extract as an anti-inflammatory agent were investigated in microglial activation by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma): it reduced the inducible nitric oxide synthase that consequently resulted in the reduction of nitric oxide.

Natural antioxidants, found in many algae, are important bioactive compounds that play an important role against various diseases and ageing processes through protection of cells from oxidative damage. In this respect, relatively little is known about the bioactivity of Hawaiian algae that could be a potential natural source of such antioxidants. The total antioxidant activity of organic extracts of 37 algal samples, comprising of 30 species of Hawaiian algae from 27 different genera was determined. The activity was determined by employing the FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) assays. Of the algae tested, the extract of Turbinaria ornata was found to be the most active. Bioassay-guided fractionation of this extract led to the isolation of a variety of different carotenoids as the active principles. The major bioactive antioxidant compound was identified as the carotenoid fucoxanthin. These results show, for the first time, that numerous Hawaiian algae exhibit significant antioxidant activity, a property that could lead to their application in one of many useful healthcare or related products as well as in chemoprevention of a variety of diseases including cancer.},

Subsequently, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were introduced for the symptomatic treatment of AD. The prevailing view has been that the efficacy of AChEIs is attained through their augmentation of acetylcholine-medicated neuron to neuron transmission. However, AChEIs also protect cells from free radical toxicity and beta-amyloid-induced injury, and increased production of antioxidants. In addition, it has been reported that AChEIs directly inhibit the release of cytokines from microglia and monocytes. These observations are supported by evidence showing a role for acetylcholine in suppression of cytokine release through a 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway'. Based on the accumulating research data so far, it is no longer appropriate to consider that the sole action of AChEIs in AD is through direct acetylcholine-medicated enhancement of neuronal transmission. Evidence points to a possible anti-inflammatory role for these agents as well.},

  abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

In this review, we discuss these innovative new approaches-including ever finer analyses of transcriptome dynamics, genome structure and genomic variation-and provide an overview of the new insights into complex biological systems catalyzed by these technologies. We also assess the impact of genotyping, genome sequencing and personal omics profiling on medical applications, including diagnosis and disease monitoring.

  abstract = {RELEVANCE: Acupuncture is an intrinsic part of traditional Chinese medicine. The current understanding of the acupuncture meridian system, acupoints and the potential utilizing Omics technologies are summarized in this review.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search for acupuncture involving Omics technologies was carried out using multiple online literature databases. The records retrieved were from the full collections of each database dated to September 2011. Data produced from functional genomic technologies were extracted from the collected acupuncture/moxibustion studies and subjected to evaluation. Analyses and comments were summarized on the advances in experimental research in acupuncture/moxibustion-related studies, and the future for strategies and approaches in the era of functional genomics highlighted.

RESULTS: An overview of articles indicated that several diseases or symptoms with evidence of effectiveness had been piloted for using functional genomic technologies, such as Parkinson's disease, allergic disorders, pain, and spinal cord injury, most of which are chronic "difficult diseases". High-throughput genomic and proteomic profiling of gene expression in tissues has been able to identify potential candidates for the effects of acupuncture and provide valuable information toward understanding the possible mechanisms of the therapy. However, without further holistic and sophisticated analyses in the context of metabolomics and systems biology, the current attempts and the foreseeable developments appear to be insufficient to produce firm conclusions. Noticeably, the recent rapid advances in functional molecular imaging targeting specific metabolites have shown great promise and if combined with other post-genomic technologies, could be extremely helpful for the acupuncture studies in human subjects.

CONCLUSION: This review suggest that disease-oriented studies using the approach of multi-indexed high-throughput technologies and systems biology analyses will be a preferred strategy for future acupuncture/moxibustion research.},

  abstract = {A variety of high throughput genome-wide assays enable the exploration of genetic risk factors underlying complex traits. Although these studies have remarkable impact on identifying susceptible biomarkers, they suffer from issues such as limited sample size and low reproducibility. Combining individual studies of different genetic levels/platforms has the promise to improve the power and consistency of biomarker identification. In this paper, we propose a novel integrative method, namely sparse group multitask regression, for integrating diverse omics datasets, platforms, and populations to identify risk genes/factors of complex diseases. This method combines multitask learning with sparse group regularization, which will: (1) treat the biomarker identification in each single study as a task and then combine them by multitask learning; (2) group variables from all studies for identifying significant genes; (3) enforce sparse constraint on groups of variables to overcome the "small sample, but large variables" problem. We introduce two sparse group penalties: sparse group lasso and sparse group ridge in our multitask model, and provide an effective algorithm for each model. In addition, we propose a significance test for the identification of potential risk genes. Two simulation studies are performed to evaluate the performance of our integrative method by comparing it with conventional meta-analysis method. The results show that our sparse group multitask method outperforms meta-analysis method significantly. In an application to our osteoporosis studies, 7 genes are identified as significant genes by our method and are found to have significant effects in other three independent studies for validation. The most significant gene SOD2 has been identified in our previous osteoporosis study involving the same expression dataset. Several other genes such as TREML2, HTR1E, and GLO1 are shown to be novel susceptible genes for osteoporosis, as confirmed from other studies.},

In particular, the research in omics sciences is moving from a hypothesis-driven to a data-driven approach.

Efficient analysis and interpretation of Big Data opens new avenues to explore molecular biology, new questions to ask about physiological and pathological states, and new ways to answer these open issues. Such analyses lead to better understanding of diseases and development of better and personalized diagnostics and therapeutics. However, such progresses are directly related to the availability of new solutions to deal with this huge amount of information. New paradigms are needed to store and access data, for its annotation and integration and finally for inferring knowledge and making it available to researchers. Bioinformatics can be viewed as the "glue" for all these processes. A clear awareness of present high performance computing (HPC) solutions in bioinformatics, Big Data analysis paradigms for computational biology, and the issues that are still open in the biomedical and healthcare fields represent the starting point to win this challenge.},

  abstract = {Diabetic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy (DN), is a major complication of diabetes and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that requires dialysis treatment or kidney transplantation. In addition to the decrease in the quality of life, DN accounts for a large proportion of the excess mortality associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Whereas the degree of glycemia plays a pivotal role in DN, a subset of individuals with poorly controlled T1D do not develop DN. Furthermore, strong familial aggregation supports genetic susceptibility to DN. However, the genes and the molecular mechanisms behind the disease remain poorly understood, and current therapeutic strategies rarely result in reversal of DN. In the GEnetics of Nephropathy: an International Effort (GENIE) consortium, we have undertaken a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of T1D DN comprising \textasciitilde{}2.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) imputed in 6,691 individuals. After additional genotyping of 41 top ranked SNPs representing 24 independent signals in 5,873 individuals, combined meta-analysis revealed association of two SNPs with ESRD: rs7583877 in the AFF3 gene (P = 1.2 \texttimes{} 10(-8)) and an intergenic SNP on chromosome 15q26 between the genes RGMA and MCTP2, rs12437854 (P = 2.0 \texttimes{} 10(-9)). Functional data suggest that AFF3 influences renal tubule fibrosis via the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-{$\beta$}1) pathway. The strongest association with DN as a primary phenotype was seen for an intronic SNP in the ERBB4 gene (rs7588550, P = 2.1 \texttimes{} 10(-7)), a gene with type 2 diabetes DN differential expression and in the same intron as a variant with cis-eQTL expression of ERBB4.

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1000477},
  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are revolutionizing the search for the genes underlying human complex diseases. The main decisions to be made at the design stage of these studies are the choice of the commercial genotyping chip to be used and the numbers of case and control samples to be genotyped. The most common method of comparing different chips is using a measure of coverage, but this fails to properly account for the effects of sample size, the genetic model of the disease, and linkage disequilibrium between SNPs. In this paper, we argue that the statistical power to detect a causative variant should be the major criterion in study design. Because of the complicated pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human genome, power cannot be calculated analytically and must instead be assessed by simulation. We describe in detail a method of simulating case-control samples at a set of linked SNPs that replicates the patterns of LD in human populations, and we used it to assess power for a comprehensive set of available genotyping chips. Our results allow us to compare the performance of the chips to detect variants with different effect sizes and allele frequencies, look at how power changes with sample size in different populations or when using multi-marker tags and genotype imputation approaches, and how performance compares to a hypothetical chip that contains every SNP in HapMap. A main conclusion of this study is that marked differences in genome coverage may not translate into appreciable differences in power and that, when taking budgetary considerations into account, the most powerful design may not always correspond to the chip with the highest coverage. We also show that genotype imputation can be used to boost the power of many chips up to the level obtained from a hypothetical "complete" chip containing all the SNPs in HapMap. Our results have been encapsulated into an R software package that allows users to design future association studies and our methods provide a framework with which new chip sets can be evaluated.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to clarify genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in renal tumors of various histological subtypes.

METHODS: Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array-based methylated CpG island amplification was performed using tissue samples of 17 patients with papillary renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), chromophobe RCCs and oncocytomas, and the results were compared with those from 51 patients with clear cell RCCs.

RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on DNA methylation status clustered type 1 and type 2 papillary RCCs into different subclasses. Although chromophobe RCCs and oncocytomas were clustered into the same subclass, the DNA methylation status of 21 BAC clones was able to discriminate chromophobe RCCs from oncocytomas. The number of BAC clones showing DNA methylation alteration in non-tumorous renal tissue from patients with chromophobe RCCs and oncocytomas was smaller than that from patients with clear cell RCCs. Biphasic accumulation of DNA methylation alterations was observed in non-tumorous renal tissue from all 68 patients, and patients showing such alterations on more BAC clones had a poorer outcome than patients showing them on fewer BAC clones.

CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation profiles determining the histological subtypes of renal tumors developing in individual patients and/or patient outcome may be already established in non-tumorous renal tissue at the precancerous stage.},

We analyzed 9p21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from eight genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with data deposited in dbGaP, including studies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cancer (GC), pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lung cancer (LC), breast cancer (BrC), bladder cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PrC). The number of subjects ranged from 2252 (PrC) to 7619 (LC). SNP-level analyses for each cancer were conducted by logistic regression or random-effects meta-analysis. A subset-based statistical approach (ASSET) was performed to combine SNP-level P values across multiple cancers. We calculated gene-level P values using the adaptive rank truncated product method. We identified that rs1063192 and rs2157719 in the CDKN2A/2B region were significantly associated with ESCC and rs2764736 (3' of TUSC1) was associated with BC (P {$\leq$} 2.59 \texttimes{} 10(-6)). ASSET analyses identified four SNPs significantly associated with multiple cancers: rs3731239 (CDKN2A intronic) with ESCC, GC and BC (P = 3.96 \texttimes{} 10(-) (4)); rs10811474 (3' of IFNW1) with RCC and BrC (P = 0.001); rs12683422 (LINGO2 intronic) with RCC and BC (P = 5.93 \texttimes{} 10(-) (4)) and rs10511729 (3' of ELAVL2) with LC and BrC (P = 8.63 \texttimes{} 10(-) (4)). At gene level, CDKN2B, CDKN2A and CDKN2B-AS1 were significantly associated with ESCC (P {$\leq$} 4.70 \texttimes{} 10(-) (5)). Rs10511729 and rs10811474 were associated with cis-expression of 9p21 genes in corresponding cancer tissues in the expression quantitative trait loci analysis. In conclusion, we identified several genetic variants in the 9p21 region associated with the risk of multiple cancers, suggesting that this region may contribute to a shared susceptibility across different cancer types.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in populations of European ancestry have identified four susceptibility loci. No GWAS has been conducted among African Americans (AA), who experience a higher incidence of RCC. We conducted a GWAS in which we analyzed 1,136,723 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among 255 cases and 375 controls of African ancestry, and further investigated 16 SNPs in a replication set (140 cases and 543 controls). The 12p11.23 variant rs10771279, located 77 kb from the European-ancestry RCC marker rs718314, was associated with RCC risk in the GWAS (P = 1.2 \texttimes{} 10(-7)) but did not replicate (P = 0.99). Consistent with European-ancestry findings, the A allele of rs7105934 on 11q13.3 was associated with decreased risk [OR, 0.76, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.64-0.91; P = 0.0022]. The frequency of this allele was higher than that observed in the European-ancestry GWAS (0.56 and 0.07, respectively, among controls). The rs7105934 association was stronger for clear cell RCC (ccRCC: OR, 0.56; P = 7.4 \texttimes{} 10(-7)) and absent for cases of other or unknown histology (OR, 1.02; P = 0.86). Analyses of rs7105934 by subtype among European-ancestry participants from these studies yielded similar findings (ORs 0.69 and 0.92, respectively). This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that rs7105934 is an RCC susceptibility locus among AAs. Our finding that the association with this SNP may be specific to clear-cell RCC is novel and requires additional investigation. Additional investigation of rs10771279 and other suggestive GWAS findings is also needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate morbidity, functional, and oncological outcomes after NSS in renal tumors {$>$} 7 cm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 168 patients with tumors {$>$} 7 cm who were treated using NSS between 1998 and 2012.

RESULTS: Imperative and elective indications accounted for 76 (45.2\%) and 92 (54.8\%) patients, respectively. Major perioperative complications and renal function deterioration occurred in 33 (19.6\%) and 51 patients (30.4\%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, age older than 60 years (P = .001; hazard ratio [HR], 5) and tumor malignancy (P = .014; HR, 6.7) were prognostic factors for renal function deterioration whereas imperative indication was a risk factor for major postoperative complications (P = .0019; HR, 2.7). In 126 (75\%) patients with malignant tumors, after a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 1-254 months), 25 patients (20.2\%) died. In multivariate analysis, imperative indication (P = .023; HR, 4.2), positive surgical margin (P = .021; HR, 3.3), and Fuhrman grade {$>$} II (P = .013; HR, 3.7) were prognostic indicators for cancer-free survival (CFS). Imperative indication (P = .04; HR, 8.5) and Fuhrman grade {$>$} II (P = .04; HR, 3.9) were predictive factors of cancer-specific survival (CSS). In case of elective indication, positive surgical margin, local recurrence, and cancer-related death occurred in 4 (7.6\%), 1 (1.1\%), and 1 (1.1\%) cases, respectively. For elective indication, 5-year estimates of CFS, CSS, and overall survival rates were: 85.7\%, 98\%, and 93.9\%, respectively.

CONCLUSION: In this selected population, imperative vs. elective indication status seems to play a critical role in oncologic outcomes. Oncologic results for elective indications are close to those reported with radical nephrectomy.},

This is one of the very few reports comparing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis with conventional karyotyping of Wilms' tumors. A total of 43 frozen tumor samples were analyzed using the Affymetrix Cytogenetics Whole-Genome 2.7M array. The findings from the SNP array analysis were then compared with those from conventional karyotyping. A comparison between SNP array and conventional karyotype findings was possible in 38 of 43 specimens (88.4\%). The SNP array and classic cytogenetic results were concordant in 33 of 38 specimens (87\%). SNP array analysis was able to support the findings of classic cytogenetics. The SNP array detected regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 41 of 43 (95\%) specimens. However, it did not detect balanced translocations and inversions that were observed by conventional cytogenetics. Our results show that the data generated from these platforms are complementary. The SNP array also detected additional gains and losses as well as regions of LOH with associated disomy, which are likely to represent segmental uniparental disomy. The observed discrepancies can be explained by the inherent limitations of each technique.},

We assessed the efficacy of a triple-combination chemotherapy in the salvage setting, beyond second-line regimens.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed institutional data on consecutive patients who received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV), cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) IV, and gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) IV on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 administrations, followed by surgery. Response, survival (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]), and safety/toxicity outcomes were the end points. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival estimates, and multiple Cox regression models were used to analyze the prognostic factors.

RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were treated from April 1999 to July 2011. Eight complete responses (CR, 10.7\%), 29 partial responses with normal markers (PRm(-), 38.7\%), and 13 cases of incomplete response/stable disease were recorded, for a major response rate (CR + PRm(-)) of 49\%. Thirty-three patients (44\%) underwent surgery, which was radical in 14 cases (42.4\%). Two-year PFS was 14.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 8.5\%-25.8\%), whereas 2-year OS was 29.5\% (95\% CI, 20.3\%-42.7\%). Five-year OS in disease-free patients (no evidence of disease) was 60.3\% (95\% CI, 42.2\%-86.2\%), and median OS between patients with and without evidence of disease was significantly different (71 [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 14-116] vs. 12.5 [IQR, 8-19] months with a 6-month landmark analysis; P = .0019).

CONCLUSION: TPG is an effective combination, and best results were achieved if a radical clearance of residual disease could be accomplished. A randomized comparison with dose-intensified regimens is advisable.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Few risk factors have been identified for renal cell carcinoma. We performed a validation study in a population with a European background to identify the most significant variants previously identified in association with renal cell carcinoma risk.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a case-control validation study after recruiting 463 controls and 463 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. For each patient and matched control we genotyped 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms selected from previous studies to evaluate the association between candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms and renal cell carcinoma susceptibility.

RESULTS: After adjusting for patient age, gender, smoking status and body mass index the AG + AA genotypes from rs7105934 (11q13) were associated with a decreased risk of renal cell carcinoma (OR 0.50, 95\% CI 0.33-0.75, p = 0.001) and~the AC + CC genotypes from rs1049380 (ITPR2) were associated with an increased risk (OR 1.66, 95\% CI 1.28-2.16, p {$<$}0.001). Kidney cancer developed at an older age in patients carrying the dominant risk allele A for rs7105934 (mean age at diagnosis 73.1 vs 68.9 years, p = 0.002) and at a younger age in those carrying the dominant allele C for rs1049380 (mean 68.1 vs 70.8 years, p = 0.005).

CONCLUSIONS: In what is to our knowledge the first validation study of the main 8~single nucleotide polymorphism variants associated with renal cell carcinoma susceptibility we confirmed the association of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms with the risk of renal cell carcinoma.

We evaluated the associations of the gene variations PAR-1 IVSn -14 A{$>$}T (rs168753), -506 Ins/Del (rs11267092) and -1426 C{$>$}T (rs32934) with renal cell carcinoma pathology and cancer specific survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes of 236 consecutive patients with renal cell carcinoma. Genotyping was done using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons and sequencing.

RESULTS: The IVSn -14 AA genotype was associated with a 3.13-fold increased risk of distant metastases (p = 0.015). In addition, cancer specific survival of patients with IVSn -14 AA was significantly worse than in those with AT/TT (HR 2.98, p = 0.019). The 1 and 4-year cancer specific survival rate for AA vs AT/TT was 89\% vs 99\% and 82\% vs 92\%, respectively. After adjusting for the stage, size, grade and necrosis (SSIGN) score on multivariable analysis, IVSn -14 AA was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor (HR 2.72, p = 0.044). The variations -506 Ins/Del and -1426 C{$>$}T were not significantly associated with pathological factors or cancer specific survival.

CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the AA genotype of the PAR-1 variation IVSn -14 A{$>$}T is associated with an increased risk of metastasis and poorer prognosis of renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, assessing the individual risk based on genotypes may be a helpful adjunct to identify subgroups at high risk for a poor clinical outcome.},

Its cancer cell antigen induced cell death activity is strongly impacted by the insertion/deletion promoter polymorphism CASP8 -652 6N ins/del (rs3834129). We studied the association of this polymorphism with renal cell carcinoma risk and pathology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this hospital based case-control study 500 Austrian patients were genotyped, including 250 with renal cell carcinoma, and 250 age and gender matched healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction amplified genomic DNA was evaluated by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and automatic sequencing. We assessed associations with renal cell carcinoma risk and pathological factors, and performed a meta-analysis of the literature.

RESULTS: The CASP8 -652 6N ins/del polymorphism was significantly linked to renal cell carcinoma (chi-square for trend = 9.50, p = 0.002). Compared with ins/ins, del/del was associated with a 57\% decreased risk of the disease (OR 0.43, 95\% CI 0.26-0.73, p = 0.002). Furthermore, del/del was associated with a lower risk of distant metastases (p {$<$}0.05) but not with T stage, N stage or grade. On meta-analysis the CASP8 -652 6N ins/del polymorphism was associated with renal cell carcinoma risk (p {$<$}0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: The del/del genotype of the CASP8 -652 6N ins/del promoter polymorphism decreases the overall risk of renal cell carcinoma. It may be associated with a decreased risk of metastasis. Larger studies are warranted to validate our findings.},

MeDIP analysis on 9 RCC tumours and 3 non-malignant normal kidney tissue samples was performed, and an initial shortlist of 56 candidate genes that were methylated by array analysis was further investigated; 9 genes were confirmed to show frequent promoter region methylation in primary RCC tumour samples (KLHL35 (39\%), QPCT (19\%), SCUBE3 (19\%), ZSCAN18 (32\%), CCDC8 (35\%), FBN2 (34\%), ATP5G2 (36\%), PCDH8 (58\%) and CORO6 (22\%)). RNAi knockdown for KLHL35, QPCT, SCUBE3, ZSCAN18, CCDC8 and FBN2 resulted in an anchorage-independent growth advantage.

  doi = {10.3892/ijo.2012.1543},
  abstract = {Many studies have recently suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the development of various types of human cancers as well as to their invasive and metastatic capacities. Previously, our miRNA expression signature of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) revealed that microRNA-138 (miR-138) was significantly reduced in cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional significance of miR-138 and to identify its target genes in RCC cells. Restoration of mature miR-138 in two RCC cell lines (A498 and 786-O) caused changes in the bleb-like cell morphology, characteristics of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Restoration also significantly inhibited migration and invasion in the two RCC cell lines, suggesting that miR-138 functions as a tumor suppressor. Genome-wide gene expression analysis (miR-138 transfectants and RCC clinical specimens) and TargetScan database studies showed that vimentin (VIM) is a promising candidate target gene of miR-138. It is well known that VIM is one of the most widely expressed mammalian intermediate filament proteins. Recent studies showed that VIM functions in cell adhesion, migration, survival and cell signaling processes via dynamic assembly/disassembly in cancer cells. We focused on VIM and investigated whether VIM was regulated by tumor suppressive miR-138 and contributed to cancer cell migration and invasion in RCC cells. Restoration of miR-138 in RCC cell lines suppressed VIM expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Silencing studies of VIM in RCC cell lines demonstrated significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion activities in si-VIM transfectants. In clinical specimens of RCC, the expression levels of VIM were significantly upregulated in cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed that VIM expression levels in RCC specimens were significantly higher than those in normal renal tissues. These data suggest that VIM may function as an oncogene and is regulated by tumor suppressive miR-138. The existence of a tumor suppressive miR-138-mediated oncogenic pathway provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of RCC oncogenesis and metastasis.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1000745},
  abstract = {Wilms' tumour (WT) is a pediatric tumor of the kidney that arises via failure of the fetal developmental program. The absence of identifiable mutations in the majority of WTs suggests the frequent involvement of epigenetic aberrations in WT. We therefore conducted a genome-wide analysis of promoter hypermethylation in WTs and identified hypermethylation at chromosome 5q31 spanning 800 kilobases (kb) and more than 50 genes. The methylated genes all belong to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-protocadherin (PCDH) gene clusters (Human Genome Organization nomenclature PCDHA@, PCDHB@, and PCDHG@, respectively). This demonstrates that long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) occurs in developmental tumors as well as in adult tumors. Bisulfite polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that PCDH hypermethylation is a frequent event found in all Wilms' tumor subtypes. Hypermethylation is concordant with reduced PCDH expression in tumors. WT precursor lesions showed no PCDH hypermethylation, suggesting that de novo PCDH hypermethylation occurs during malignant progression. Discrete boundaries of the PCDH domain are delimited by abrupt changes in histone modifications; unmethylated genes flanking the LRES are associated with permissive marks which are absent from methylated genes within the domain. Silenced genes are marked with non-permissive histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation. Expression analysis of embryonic murine kidney and differentiating rat metanephric mesenchymal cells demonstrates that Pcdh expression is developmentally regulated and that Pcdhg@ genes are expressed in blastemal cells. Importantly, we show that PCDHs negatively regulate canonical Wnt signalling, as short-interfering RNA-induced reduction of PCDHG@ encoded proteins leads to elevated beta-catenin protein, increased beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) reporter activity, and induction of Wnt target genes. Conversely, over-expression of PCDHs suppresses beta-catenin/TCF-reporter activity and also inhibits colony formation and growth of cancer cells in soft agar. Thus PCDHs are candidate tumor suppressors that modulate regulatory pathways critical in development and disease, such as canonical Wnt signaling.},

  abstract = {There has been increased interest in discovering combinations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strongly associated with a phenotype even if each SNP has little individual effect. Efficient approaches have been proposed for searching two-locus combinations from genome-wide datasets. However, for high-order combinations, existing methods either adopt a brute-force search which only handles a small number of SNPs (up to few hundreds), or use heuristic search that may miss informative combinations. In addition, existing approaches lack statistical power because of the use of statistics with high degrees-of-freedom and the huge number of hypotheses tested during combinatorial search. Due to these challenges, functional interactions in high-order combinations have not been systematically explored. We leverage discriminative-pattern-mining algorithms from the data-mining community to search for high-order combinations in case-control datasets. The substantially improved efficiency and scalability demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets with several thousands of SNPs allows the study of several important mathematical and statistical properties of SNP combinations with order as high as eleven. We further explore functional interactions in high-order combinations and reveal a general connection between the increase in discriminative power of a combination over its subsets and the functional coherence among the genes comprising the combination, supported by multiple datasets. Finally, we study several significant high-order combinations discovered from a lung-cancer dataset and a kidney-transplant-rejection dataset in detail to provide novel insights on the complex diseases. Interestingly, many of these associations involve combinations of common variations that occur in small fractions of population. Thus, our approach is an alternative methodology for exploring the genetics of rare diseases for which the current focus is on individually rare variations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Emerging molecular targeting therapeutics have been incorporated into the management of advanced renal cell carcinoma; however, their efficacy remains limited. The aim of this study was to catalog potential therapeutic target molecules for renal cell carcinoma.

METHODS: We first selected genes up-regulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma relative to surrounding normal kidney tissues in 10 patients (Study Cohort) using high-density exon arrays that detect all potential transcripts predicted in the human genome. The selected genes were subjected to independent validation in another set of 10 patients (Validation Cohort) using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and functional screening using small interfering RNA in six clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell lines.

RESULTS: We identified 164 genes whose expression was significantly elevated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (P{$<$} 0.0001 [Student's t-test] and at least a 3-fold change in transcription signal). We finally extracted 33 genes required for maintaining cell proliferation in at least two clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell lines. The 33 genes included 13 genes known to be associated with the development/progression of renal cell carcinoma, including CAIX and FLT-1, confirming the robustness of the current strategy.

CONCLUSIONS: Through a combination of genome-wide expression and functional assays, we identified a set of genes with high potential as targets for drug development. This method is rapid and comprehensive and could be applied to the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancers other than clear cell renal cell carcinoma.},

In our study, we assessed whether these polymorphisms are also associated with RCC risk in a Chinese population. We genotyped these polymorphisms using TaqMan method and assessed their associations with RCC risk in a case-control study of 710 patients with histologically confirmed RCC and 760 cancer-free controls. Normal renal tissues adjacent to tumors were used to evaluate the functional consequences of these polymorphisms. We found that rs7105934 was significantly associated with reduced RCC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.67, 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.47-0.95, GA+AA versus GG], particularly among subgroups of normal-weight individuals (OR = 0.51, 95\%CI = 0.29-0.88), never-smokers (OR = 0.53, 95\%CI = 0.33-0.85) and non-drinkers (OR = 0.57, 95\%CI = 0.370.87). Furthermore, the rs7105934 GA genotype was associated with lower levels of CCND1 mRNA compared with GG genotype, although this association was only marginally significant (P = 0.055). No significant association between rs7579899 or rs7105934 and RCC risk was observed. Our results suggest that rs7105934 on 11q13.3 may confer susceptibility to RCC in our population. Large population-based prospective and functional studies are required to validate the associations between these loci and RCC risk.},

Here, we integrated an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen for ccRCC survival regulators with an analysis of recurrently overexpressed genes in ccRCC to identify new therapeutic targets in this disease. One of the most potent survival regulators, the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 (SLC16A3), impaired ccRCC viability in all eight ccRCC lines tested and was the seventh most overexpressed gene in a meta-analysis of five ccRCC expression datasets. MCT4 silencing impaired secretion of lactate generated through glycolysis and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Silencing MCT4 resulted in intracellular acidosis, and reduction in intracellular ATP production together with partial reversion of the Warburg effect in ccRCC cell lines. Intra-tumoural heterogeneity in the intensity of MCT4 protein expression was observed in primary ccRCCs. MCT4 protein expression analysis based on the highest intensity of expression in primary ccRCCs was associated with poorer relapse-free survival, whereas modal intensity correlated with Fuhrman nuclear grade. Consistent with the potential selection of subclones enriched for MCT4 expression during disease progression, MCT4 expression was greater at sites of metastatic disease. These data suggest that MCT4 may serve as a novel metabolic target to reverse the Warburg effect and limit disease progression in ccRCC.},

We performed an integrated, genome-wide analysis of copy-number changes and gene expression profiles in 90 tumors, including both sporadic and VHL disease-associated tumors, in hopes of identifying new therapeutic targets in ccRCC. We identified 14 regions of nonrandom copy-number change, including 7 regions of amplification (1q, 2q, 5q, 7q, 8q, 12p, and 20q) and 7 regions of deletion (1p, 3p, 4q, 6q, 8p, 9p, and 14q). An analysis aimed at identifying the relevant genes revealed VHL as one of three genes in the 3p deletion peak, CDKN2A and CDKN2B as the only genes in the 9p deletion peak, and MYC as the only gene in the 8q amplification peak. An integrated analysis to identify genes in amplification peaks that are consistently overexpressed among amplified samples confirmed MYC as a potential target of 8q amplification and identified candidate oncogenes in the other regions. A comparison of genomic profiles revealed that VHL disease-associated tumors are similar to a subgroup of sporadic tumors and thus more homogeneous overall. Sporadic tumors without evidence of biallelic VHL inactivation fell into two groups: one group with genomic profiles highly dissimilar to the majority of ccRCC and a second group with genomic profiles that are much more similar to tumors with biallelic inactivation of VHL.},

By unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on BAMCA data for their N, 51 patients with clear cell RCCs were clustered into two subclasses, Clusters A(N) (n = 46) and B(N) (n = 5).

  abstract = {Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal urologic cancer. Only two common susceptibility loci for RCC have been confirmed to date. To identify additional RCC common susceptibility loci, we conducted an independent genome-wide association study (GWAS). We analyzed 533 191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with RCC in 894 cases and 1516 controls of European descent recruited from MD Anderson Cancer Center in the primary scan, and validated the top 500 SNPs in silico in 3772 cases and 8505 controls of European descent involved in the only published GWAS of RCC. We identified two common variants in linkage disequilibrium, rs718314 and rs1049380 (r(2) = 0.64, D{$\mkern1mu$}' = 0.84), in the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, type 2 (ITPR2) gene on 12p11.23 as novel susceptibility loci for RCC (P = 8.89 \texttimes{} 10(-10) and P = 6.07 \texttimes{} 10(-9), respectively, in meta-analysis) with an allelic odds ratio of 1.19 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.26] for rs718314 and 1.18 (95\% CI: 1.12-1.25) for rs1049380. It has been recently identified that rs718314 in ITPR2 is associated with waist-hip ratio (WHR) phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic locus associated with both cancer risk and WHR.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The integrity of RNA molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of RNA extraction. Until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of RNA samples and the ratio of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. The advent of microcapillary electrophoretic RNA separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of RNA samples in an unambiguous way. METHODS: A method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a Bayesian learning technique. Feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the Bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability. RESULTS: This approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic RNA measurements recorded with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes RNA integrity. The resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of RNA quality control that allows the calculation of an RNA integrity number (RIN). CONCLUSION: Our results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of RNA integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.},

Materials and Methods: Lung cancer cell lines (A549, NCI-H1650) were irradiated with several fractionation schemes. Clonogenic assays were used to identify radioresistant cell lines. We compared the gene expression profiles on a cDNA microarray. Results: Four established cell (A549-2G, A549-5G, H1650-2G and H1650-5G) were shown to be radioresistant (p{$\leq$}0.05). Seventy-two genes were commonly altered in A549-G and 655 genes in H1650-G, compared to their parental cells. Genes in the wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) signaling pathway were the ones most frequently altered in both A549-G and H1650-G cells. Those involved in inflammation; integrin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), interleukin, transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, were commonly altered in radioresistant H1650 sublines.

Microarray analysis has the capability to offer robust multiplex detection but has just started to enter the diagnostic microbiology laboratory. Multiple microarray platforms exist, including printed double-stranded DNA and oligonucleotide arrays, in situ-synthesized arrays, high-density bead arrays, electronic microarrays, and suspension bead arrays. One aim of this paper is to review microarray technology, highlighting technical differences between them and each platform's advantages and disadvantages. Although the use of microarrays to generate gene expression data has become routine, applications pertinent to clinical microbiology continue to rapidly expand. This review highlights uses of microarray technology that impact diagnostic microbiology, including the detection and identification of pathogens, determination of antimicrobial resistance, epidemiological strain typing, and analysis of microbial infections using host genomic expression and polymorphism profiles.},

  abstract = {Cervical cancer, the malignant neoplasm of the cervix uteri is the second most common cancer among women worldwide and the top-most cancer in India. Several factors are responsible for causing cervical cancer, which alter the expression of oncogenic genes resulting in up or down-regulation of gene expression and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes/gene products. Gene expression is regulated by interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and specific regulatory elements in the promoter regions of target genes. Thus, it is important to decipher and analyze TFs that bind to regulatory regions of diseased genes and regulate their expression. In the present study, computational methods involving the combination of gene expression data from microarray experiments and promoter sequence analysis of a curated gene set involved in the cervical cancer causation have been utilized for identifying potential regulatory elements. Consensus predictions of two approaches led to the identification of twelve TFs that might be crucial to the regulation of cervical cancer progression. Subsequently, TF enrichment and oncomine expression analysis suggested that the transcription factor family E2F played an important role for the regulation of genes involve in cervical carcinogenesis. Our results suggest that E2F possesses diagnostic/prognostic value and can act as a potential drug target in cervical cancer.},

  abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) widely expands proteome diversity through the combinatorial assembly of exons. The analysis of AS on a large scale, by using splice-sensitive microarrays, is a highly efficient method to detect the majority of known and predicted alternative transcripts for a given gene. The response to targeted anticancer therapies cannot easily be anticipated without prior knowledge of the expression, by the tumor, of target proteins or genes. To analyze, in depth, transcript structure and levels for genes involved in these responses, including AKT1-3, HER1-4, HIF1A, PIK3CA, PIK3R1-2, VEGFA-D and PIR, we engineered a dedicated gene chip with coverage of an average 185 probes per gene and, especially, exon-exon junction probes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the ability of such a chip to detect the effects of over-expressed SRSF2 RNA binding protein on the structure and abundance of mRNA products in H358 lung cancer cells conditionally over-expressing SRSF2. Major splicing changes were observed, including in HER1/EGFR pre-mRNA, which were also seen in human lung cancer samples over-expressing the SRSF2 protein. In addition, we showed that variations in HER1/EGFR pre-mRNA splicing triggered by SRSF2 overexpression in H358 cells resulted in a drop in HER1/EGFR protein level, which correlated with increased sensitivity to gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We propose, therefore, that this novel tool could be especially relevant for clinical applications, with the aim to predict the response before treatment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important pathogen. Its resistance to multiple antibiotics and its prevalence in healthcare establishments make it a serious threat to human health that requires novel interventions. Manuka honey is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that is gaining acceptance in the topical treatment of wounds. Because its mode of action is only partially understood, proteomic and genomic analysis was used to investigate the effects of manuka honey on MRSA at a molecular level.

METHODS: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with dual-channel imaging was combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to determine the identities of differentially expressed proteins. The expression of the corresponding genes was investigated by quantitative PCR. Microarray analysis provided an overview of alterations in gene expression across the MRSA genome.

RESULTS: Genes with increased expression following exposure to manuka honey were associated with glycolysis, transport and biosynthesis of amino acids, proteins and purines. Those with decreased expression were involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, cell division, quorum sensing and virulence. The greatest reductions were seen in genes conferring virulence (sec3, fnb, hlgA, lip and hla) and coincided with a down-regulation of global regulators, such as agr, sae and sarV. A model to illustrate these multiple effects was constructed and implicated glucose, which is one of the major sugars contained in honey.

CONCLUSIONS: A decreased expression of virulence genes in MRSA will impact on its pathogenicity and needs to be investigated in vivo.},

The purpose of this study is to expand understanding of how biologists, computational biologists, bioinformaticians, medical practitioners and scientists would benefit from next-generation sequencing and microarray technology in analyzing DNA and protein dataset. Microarrays techniques usage in analyzing biological dataset (gene expression) has grown exponentially for the past two decades. Recently, next generation sequencing technologies are revolutionizing the DNA/RNA sequencing tasks. These highly efficient parallel sequencing methods make it possible to generate billions of bases of sequence per day in a biological laboratory. These methods allow individual human genomes to be sequenced in an instant or one to two days. In this paper, a comparative study of next generation sequencing technology and microarray technology would be presented and the performance of the two techniques would be discussed.},

Gene expression has a very dynamic nature; it acts as a bridge between epigenetic marks, DNA sequence and proteins and changes to accommodate the requirements of the cell at each given time. Recent technological advances have created new opportunities to study complex phenotypes from a global point of view. From an animal production perspective, muscle transcriptomics has been investigated in relation to muscle growth, carcass fattening and meat quality traits. In this review, we discuss the impact of nutritional, anatomical and genetic factors on muscle gene expression and meat quality of pigs assessed by microarray technologies. Altogether, several common themes have been revealed by the in-depth analysis of the current body of knowledge, for instance, the involvement of genes related to energy balance and substrate turnover in the oxidative/glycolytic phenotype of red/white muscle fibre types and in the storage of intramuscular fat. The review also covers recent advances in the discovery of expression QTL and regulatory RNAs in porcine breeds as well as technical developments in the field of deep-sequencing technologies that are expected to substantially increase our knowledge about the genetic architecture of meat quality and production traits.},

Here we describe a maskless array synthesizer (MAS) that replaces the chrome masks with virtual masks generated on a computer, which are relayed to a digital micromirror array. A 1:1 reflective imaging system forms an ultraviolet image of the virtual mask on the active surface of the glass substrate, which is mounted in a flow cell reaction chamber connected to a DNA synthesizer. Programmed chemical coupling cycles follow light exposure, and these steps are repeated with different virtual masks to grow desired oligonucleotides in a selected pattern. This instrument has been used to synthesize oligonucleotide microarrays containing more than 76,000 features measuring 16 microm 2. The oligonucleotides were synthesized at high repetitive yield and, after hybridization, could readily discriminate single-base pair mismatches. The MAS is adaptable to the fabrication of DNA chips containing probes for thousands of genes, as well as any other solid-phase combinatorial chemistry to be performed in high-density microarrays.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diluted preparations obtained from Apis mellifica are reported in the homeopathic literature to have anti-inflammatory activity. The present study was designed to explore the effects on global gene expression profiles of human cells by means of microarrays, using Apis mellifica mother tincture (TM) and its 3C, 5C, 7C dynamized dilutions; the technique employed allowed us to study the changes in gene expression at concentrations much lower than those associated with pharmacological responses.

METHODS: An RWPE-1 cell line (human immortalized prostate epithelial cells) was used to study the effects on global gene expression by transcriptomic analysis.

RESULTS: Apis mellifica TM and its 3C, 5C, 7C dynamized dilutions modulated hundreds of genes; using cluster analysis we observed groups of genes up- or down-regulated with similar expression profiles among treatments; other genes showed opposite regulation profiles at low and high dilutions of Apis mellifica, suggesting a hormetic response. In particular, genes involved in cytokine expression, inflammatory processes, anti-oxidative responses and proteasome degradation were differentially, and sometimes divergently expressed by the TM or by Apis mellifica 3C, 5C and 7C dilutions. We confirmed these data by RT-PCR analyses on 5 selected candidate genes (IL1{$\beta$}, CD46, ATF1, UBE2Q2 and MT1X).

CONCLUSIONS: Apis mellifica TM modifies gene expression in human cells and has inhibitory effects on regulatory processes of inflammation; in addition, extremely diluted dynamized dilutions (3C, 5C and 7C) still exert significant effects on genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress.},

Finally, we integrated the chemotherapy response signatures with signatures of oncogenic pathway deregulation to identify new therapeutic strategies that make use of all available drugs.

We designed an exonic-resolution array targeting all known submicroscopic chromosomal intellectual disability syndrome loci, causative genes for intellectual disability, and potential candidate genes, all genes encoding glutamate receptors and epigenetic regulators. Using this platform, we performed chromosomal microarray analysis on 165 intellectual disability trios (affected child and both normal parents). We identified and independently validated 36 de novo copy-number changes in 32 trios. In all, 67\% of the validated events were intragenic, involving only exon 1 (which includes the promoter sequence according to our design), exon 1 and adjacent exons, or one or more exons excluding exon 1. Seventeen of the 36 copy-number variants involve genes known to cause intellectual disability. Eleven of these, including seven intragenic variants, are clearly pathogenic (involving STXBP1, SHANK3 (3 patients), IL1RAPL1, UBE2A, NRXN1, MEF2C, CHD7, 15q24 and 9p24 microdeletion), two are likely pathogenic (PI4KA, DCX), two are unlikely to be pathogenic (GRIK2, FREM2), and two are unclear (ARID1B, 15q22 microdeletion). Twelve individuals with genomic imbalances identified by our array were tested with a clinical microarray, and six had a normal result. We identified de novo copy-number variants within genes not previously implicated in intellectual disability and uncovered pathogenic variation of known intellectual disability genes below the detection limit of standard clinical diagnostic chromosomal microarray analysis.},

  doi = {10.1373/clinchem.2012.193813},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Public sharing of scientific data has assumed greater importance in the omics era. Transparency is necessary for confirmation and validation, and multiple examiners aid in extracting maximal value from large data sets. Accordingly, database submission and provision of the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)(3) are required by most journals as a prerequisite for review or acceptance.

METHODS: In this study, the level of data submission and MIAME compliance was reviewed for 127 articles that included microarray-based microRNA (miRNA) profiling and were published from July 2011 through April 2012 in the journals that published the largest number of such articles--PLOS ONE, the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Blood, and Oncogene--along with articles from 9 other journals, including Clinical Chemistry, that published smaller numbers of array-based articles.

RESULTS: Overall, data submission was reported at publication for {$<$}40\% of all articles, and almost 75\% of articles were MIAME noncompliant. On average, articles that included full data submission scored significantly higher on a quality metric than articles with limited or no data submission, and studies with adequate description of methods disproportionately included larger numbers of experimental repeats. Finally, for several articles that were not MIAME compliant, data reanalysis revealed less than complete support for the published conclusions, in 1 case leading to retraction.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings buttress the hypothesis that reluctance to share data is associated with low study quality and suggest that most miRNA array investigations are underpowered and/or potentially compromised by a lack of appropriate reporting and data submission.},

Microarrays are reliable and more cost effective than RNA-Seq for gene expression profiling in model organisms. RNA-Seq will eventually be used more routinely than microarray, but right now the techniques can be complementary to each other. Microarrays will not become obsolete but might be relegated to only a few uses. RNA-Seq clearly has a bright future in bioinformatic data collection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarrays have revolutionized breast cancer (BC) research by enabling studies of gene expression on a transcriptome-wide scale. Recently, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as an alternative for precise readouts of the transcriptome. To date, no study has compared the ability of the two technologies to quantify clinically relevant individual genes and microarray-derived gene expression signatures (GES) in a set of BC samples encompassing the known molecular BC's subtypes. To accomplish this, the RNA from 57 BCs representing the four main molecular subtypes (triple negative, HER2 positive, luminal A, luminal B), was profiled with Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chips and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The correlations of three clinically relevant BC genes, six molecular subtype classifiers, and a selection of 21 GES were evaluated. RESULTS: 16,097 genes common to the two platforms were retained for downstream analysis. Gene-wise comparison of microarray and RNA-Seq data revealed that 52\% had a Spearman's correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 with highly correlated genes displaying significantly higher expression levels. We found excellent correlation between microarray and RNA-Seq for the estrogen receptor (ER; rs =0.973; 95\%CI: 0.971-0.975), progesterone receptor (PgR; rs =0.95; 0.947-0.954), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; rs =0.918; 0.912-0.923), while a few discordances between ER and PgR quantified by immunohistochemistry and RNA-Seq/microarray were observed. All the subtype classifiers evaluated agreed well (Cohen's kappa coefficients {$>$}0.8) and all the proliferation-based GES showed excellent Spearman correlations between microarray and RNA-Seq (all rs {$>$}0.965). Immune-, stroma- and pathway-based GES showed a lower correlation relative to prognostic signatures (all rs {$>$}0.6). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a systematic comparison of RNA-Seq to microarray for the evaluation of single genes and GES clinically relevant to BC. According to our results, the vast majority of single gene biomarkers and well-established GES can be reliably evaluated using the RNA-Seq technology.},

  abstract = {Both clinical and analytical metrics produced by microarray-based assay technology have recognized problems in reproducibility, reliability and analytical sensitivity. These issues are often attributed to poor understanding and control of nucleic acid behaviors and properties at solid-liquid interfaces. Nucleic acid hybridization, central to DNA and RNA microarray formats, depends on the properties and behaviors of single strand (ss) nucleic acids (e.g., probe oligomeric DNA) bound to surfaces. ssDNA's persistence length, radius of gyration, electrostatics, conformations on different surfaces and under various assay conditions, its chain flexibility and curvature, charging effects in ionic solutions, and fluorescent labeling all influence its physical chemistry and hybridization under assay conditions. Nucleic acid (e.g., both RNA and DNA) target interactions with immobilized ssDNA strands are highly impacted by these biophysical states. Furthermore, the kinetics, thermodynamics, and enthalpic and entropic contributions to DNA hybridization reflect global probe/target structures and interaction dynamics. Here we review several biophysical issues relevant to oligomeric nucleic acid molecular behaviors at surfaces and their influences on duplex formation that influence microarray assay performance. Correlation of biophysical aspects of single and double-stranded nucleic acids with their complexes in bulk solution is common. Such analysis at surfaces is not commonly reported, despite its importance to microarray assays. We seek to provide further insight into nucleic acid-surface challenges facing microarray diagnostic formats that have hindered their clinical adoption and compromise their research quality and value as genomics tools.},

  abstract = {Recent technological advances have improved the whole slide imaging (WSI) scanner quality and reduced the cost of storage, thereby enabling the deployment of digital pathology for routine diagnostics. In this paper we present the experiences from two Swedish sites having deployed routine large-scale WSI for primary review. At Kalmar County Hospital, the digitization process started in 2006 to reduce the time spent at the microscope in order to improve the ergonomics. Since 2008, more than 500,000 glass slides have been scanned in the routine operations of Kalmar and the neighboring Link\"oping University Hospital. All glass slides are digitally scanned yet they are also physically delivered to the consulting pathologist who can choose to review the slides on screen, in the microscope, or both. The digital operations include regular remote case reporting by a few hospital pathologists, as well as around 150 cases per week where primary review is outsourced to a private clinic. To investigate how the pathologists choose to use the digital slides, a web-based questionnaire was designed and sent out to the pathologists in Kalmar and Link\"oping. The responses showed that almost all pathologists think that ergonomics have improved and that image quality was sufficient for most histopathologic diagnostic work. 38 {$\pm$} 28\% of the cases were diagnosed digitally, but the survey also revealed that the pathologists commonly switch back and forth between digital and conventional microscopy within the same case. The fact that two full-scale digital systems have been implemented and that a large portion of the primary reporting is voluntarily performed digitally shows that large-scale digitization is possible today.},

As the cost of sequencing declines, next-generation sequencing (NGS) instruments and datasets will become increasingly accessible to the wider research community. Investigators are understandably eager to harness the power of these new technologies. Sequencing human genomes on these platforms, however, presents numerous production and bioinformatics challenges. Production issues like sample contamination, library chimaeras and variable run quality have become increasingly problematic in the transition from technology development lab to production floor. Analysis of NGS data, too, remains challenging, particularly given the short-read lengths (35-250 bp) and sheer volume of data. The development of streamlined, highly automated pipelines for data analysis is critical for transition from technology adoption to accelerated research and publication. This review aims to describe the state of current NGS technologies, as well as the strategies that enable NGS users to characterize the full spectrum of DNA sequence variation in humans.},

  volume = {15},
  issn = {1471-2164},
  doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-15-955},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few, if any, protozoan parasites are reported to exhibit extreme organ tropism like the flagellate Tritrichomonas foetus. In cattle, T. foetus infects the reproductive system causing abortion, whereas the infection in cats results in chronic large bowel diarrhoea. In the absence of a T. foetus genome, we utilized a de novo approach to assemble the transcriptome of the bovine and feline genotype to identify host-specific adaptations and virulence factors specific to each genotype. Furthermore, a subset of orthologs was used to characterize putative druggable targets and expose complications of in silico drug target mining in species with indefinite host-ranges.

RESULTS: Illumina RNA-seq reads were assembled into two representative bovine and feline transcriptomes containing 42,363 and 36,559 contigs, respectively. Coding and non-coding regions of the genome libraries revealed striking similarities, with 24,620 shared homolog pairs reduced down to 7,547 coding orthologs between the two genotypes. The transcriptomes were near identical in functional category distribution; with no indication of selective pressure acting on orthologs despite differences in parasite origins/host. Orthologs formed a large proportion of highly expressed transcripts in both genotypes (bovine genotype: 76\%, feline genotype: 56\%). Mining the libraries for protease virulence factors revealed the cysteine proteases (CP) to be the most common. In total, 483 and 445 bovine and feline T. foetus transcripts were identified as putative proteases based on MEROPS database, with 9 hits to putative protease inhibitors. In bovine T. foetus, CP8 is the preferentially transcribed CP while in the feline genotype, transcription of CP7 showed higher abundance. In silico druggability analysis of the two genotypes revealed that when host sequences are taken into account, drug targets are genotype-specific.

CONCLUSION: Gene discovery analysis based on RNA-seq data analysis revealed prominent similarities between the bovine and feline T. foetus, suggesting recent adaptation to their respective host/niche. T. foetus represents a unique case of a mammalian protozoan expanding its parasitic grasp across distantly related host lineages. Consequences of the host-range for in silico drug targeting are exposed here, demonstrating that targets of the parasite in one host are not necessarily ideal for the same parasite in another host.},

Clinical studies have shown that molecular targeted therapies increase survival and improve quality of life in patients. Nevertheless, the realization of personalized therapies for NSCLC faces a number of challenges including the integration of clinical and genetic data and a lack of clinical decision support tools to assist physicians with patient selection. To address this problem, we used frequent pattern mining to establish the relationships of patient characteristics and tumor response in advanced NSCLC. Univariate analysis determined that smoking status, histology, EGFR mutation, and targeted drug were significantly associated with response to targeted therapy. We applied four classifiers to predict treatment outcome from EGFR-TKIs. Overall, the highest classification accuracy was 76.56\% and the AUC was 0.76. The decision tree used a combination of EGFR mutations, histology, and smoking status to predict tumor response and the output was both easily understandable and in keeping with current knowledge. Our findings suggest that support vector machines and decision trees are a promising approach for clinical decision support in the patient selection for targeted therapy in advanced NSCLC.},

Then, a physician can learn valuable knowledge from the data mining processes. Here, we present a study focused on the investigation of the application of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques to the prediction models of breast cancer. The artificial neural network, decision tree, logistic regression, and genetic algorithm were used for the comparative studies and the accuracy and positive predictive value of each algorithm were used as the evaluation indicators. 699 records acquired from the breast cancer patients at the University of Wisconsin, nine predictor variables, and one outcome variable were incorporated for the data analysis followed by the tenfold cross-validation. The results revealed that the accuracies of logistic regression model were 0.9434 (sensitivity 0.9716 and specificity 0.9482), the decision tree model 0.9434 (sensitivity 0.9615, specificity 0.9105), the neural network model 0.9502 (sensitivity 0.9628, specificity 0.9273), and the genetic algorithm model 0.9878 (sensitivity 1, specificity 0.9802). The accuracy of the genetic algorithm was significantly higher than the average predicted accuracy of 0.9612. The predicted outcome of the logistic regression model was higher than that of the neural network model but no significant difference was observed. The average predicted accuracy of the decision tree model was 0.9435 which was the lowest of all four predictive models. The standard deviation of the tenfold cross-validation was rather unreliable. This study indicated that the genetic algorithm model yielded better results than other data mining models for the analysis of the data of breast cancer patients in terms of the overall accuracy of the patient classification, the expression and complexity of the classification rule. The results showed that the genetic algorithm described in the present study was able to produce accurate results in the classification of breast cancer data and the classification rule identified was more acceptable and comprehensible.},

  abstract = {Anticancer drug-associated side effect knowledge often exists in multiple heterogeneous and complementary data sources. A comprehensive anticancer drug-side effect (drug-SE) relationship knowledge base is important for computation-based drug target discovery, drug toxicity predication and drug repositioning. In this study, we present a two-step approach by combining table classification and relationship extraction to extract drug-SE pairs from a large number of high-profile oncological full-text articles. The data consists of 31,255 tables downloaded from the Journal of Oncology (JCO). We first trained a statistical classifier to classify tables into SE-related and -unrelated categories. We then extracted drug-SE pairs from SE-related tables. We compared drug side effect knowledge extracted from JCO tables to that derived from FDA drug labels. Finally, we systematically analyzed relationships between anti-cancer drug-associated side effects and drug-associated gene targets, metabolism genes, and disease indications. The statistical table classifier is effective in classifying tables into SE-related and -unrelated (precision: 0.711; recall: 0.941; F1: 0.810). We extracted a total of 26,918 drug-SE pairs from SE-related tables with a precision of 0.605, a recall of 0.460, and a F1 of 0.520. Drug-SE pairs extracted from JCO tables is largely complementary to those derived from FDA drug labels; as many as 84.7\% of the pairs extracted from JCO tables have not been included a side effect database constructed from FDA drug labels. Side effects associated with anticancer drugs positively correlate with drug target genes, drug metabolism genes, and disease indications.},

  abstract = {Text mining is a flexible technology that can be applied to numerous different tasks in biology and medicine. We present a system for extracting disease-gene associations from biomedical abstracts. The system consists of a highly efficient dictionary-based tagger for named entity recognition of human genes and diseases, which we combine with a scoring scheme that takes into account co-occurrences both within and between sentences. We show that this approach is able to extract half of all manually curated associations with a false positive rate of only 0.16\%. Nonetheless, text mining should not stand alone, but be combined with other types of evidence. For this reason, we have developed the DISEASES resource, which integrates the results from text mining with manually curated disease-gene associations, cancer mutation data, and genome-wide association studies from existing databases. The DISEASES resource is accessible through a web interface at http://diseases.jensenlab.org/, where the text-mining software and all associations are also freely available for download.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is well known for its aggressiveness, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear, limiting the treatment. In the present study, we showed that miR-181c, a commonly downregulated miRNA in GBM reported by several miRNA profiles, was associated with the mesenchymal subtype of GBM and predicted the outcome for patients from a GBM cohort (n=518) obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. A multivariate analysis showed that miR-181c was an independent prognostic indicator for GBM patients. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that miR-181c was expressed poorly in neurospheres of glioma cells that resemble glioma stem cells. Proliferation and invasion assays showed that miR-181c also blocked the proliferation and invasion abilities of glioma cells. Limiting dilution and colony formation assays showed that miR-181c attenuated the self-renewal ability of glioma cells. Finally, investigation of the mechanism defined Notch2, a key molecular of Notch signaling, as the functional downstream target of miR-181c. An inverse correlation was found between miR-181c and Notch2 in glioma cells and verified in fresh glioma samples. Taken together, the present study showed that miR-181c can be considered a valuable indicator for the outcome of GBM patients. miR-181c acts as a tumor suppressor that attenuates proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal capacities by downregulation of Notch2 in glioma cells.},

A second wave of proteome reorganization occurs in a later stage of reprogramming, where we characterize the proteome of two distinct pluripotent cellular populations. In addition, the overlay of our proteome resource with parallel generated -omics data is explored to identify post-transcriptionally regulated proteins involved in key steps during reprogramming.},

Coupled with concomitant improvements in computer power, this research has resulted in a greater variety of exact procedures becoming feasible for practical use and a considerable increase in the size of data sets to which the procedures can be applied. For some basic analyses of contingency tables, it is unnecessary to use large-sample approximations to sampling distributions when their adequacy is in doubt. This article surveys the current theoretical and computational developments of exact methods for contingency tables. Primary attention is given to the exact conditional approach, which eliminates nuisance parameters by conditioning on their sufficient statistics. The presentation of various exact inferences is unified by expressing them in terms of parameters and their sufficient statistics in loglinear models. Exact approaches for many inferences are not yet addressed in the literature, particularly for multidimensional contingency tables, and this article also suggests additional research for the next decade that would make exact methods yet more widely applicable.},

Traditional Chinese medicine encompasses a well established alternate system of medicine based on a broad range of herbal formulations and is practiced extensively in the region for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. In recent years, several reports describe in depth studies of the molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines on the biological activities including anti-bacterial activities. The availability of a well-curated dataset of molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines and accurate in-silico cheminformatics models for data mining for antitubercular agents and computational filters to prioritize molecules has prompted us to search for potential hits from these datasets. Results. We used a consensus approach to predict molecules with potential antitubercular activities from a large dataset of molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines available in the public domain. We further prioritized 160 molecules based on five computational filters (SMARTSfilter) so as to avoid potentially undesirable molecules. We further examined the molecules for permeability across Mycobacterial cell wall and for potential activities against non-replicating and drug tolerant Mycobacteria. Additional in-depth literature surveys for the reported antitubercular activities of the molecular ingredients and their sources were considered for drawing support to prioritization. Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that datasets of molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines offer a new opportunity to mine for potential biological activities. In this report, we suggest a proof-of-concept methodology to prioritize molecules for further experimental assays using a variety of computational tools. We also additionally suggest that a subset of prioritized molecules could be used for evaluation for tuberculosis due to their additional effect against non-replicating tuberculosis as well as the additional hepato-protection offered by the source of these ingredients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The phenome represents a distinct set of information in the human population. It has been explored particularly in its relationship with the genome to identify correlations for diseases. The phenome has been also explored for drug repositioning with efforts focusing on the search space for the most similar candidate drugs. For a comprehensive analysis of the phenome, we assumed that all phenotypes (indications and side effects) were inter-connected with a probabilistic distribution and this characteristic may offer an opportunity to identify new therapeutic indications for a given drug. Correspondingly, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which introduces latent variables (topics) to govern the phenome distribution.

RESULTS: We developed our model on the phenome information in Side Effect Resource (SIDER). We first developed a LDA model optimized based on its recovery potential through perturbing the drug-phenotype matrix for each of the drug-indication pairs where each drug-indication relationship was switched to "unknown" one at the time and then recovered based on the remaining drug-phenotype pairs. Of the probabilistically significant pairs, 70\% was successfully recovered. Next, we applied the model on the whole phenome to narrow down repositioning candidates and suggest alternative indications. We were able to retrieve approved indications of 6 drugs whose indications were not listed in SIDER. For 908 drugs that were present with their indication information, our model suggested alternative treatment options for further investigations. Several of the suggested new uses can be supported with information from the scientific literature.

CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the phenome can be further analyzed by a generative model, which can discover probabilistic associations between drugs and therapeutic uses. In this regard, LDA serves as an enrichment tool to explore new uses of existing drugs by narrowing down the search space.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats, ranging from hundreds to thousands in number, located in the noncoding region of the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene represent the most common genetic abnormality for familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (abbreviated as C9ALS). Currently, three pathological mechanisms, such as haplo insufficiency of C9orf72, formation of nuclear RNA foci composed of sense and antisense repeats, and accumulation of unconventionally transcribed dipeptide-repeat (DPR) proteins, are proposed for C9ALS. However, at present, the central mechanism underlying neurodegeneration in C9ALS remains largely unknown.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS: By using three distinct pathway analysis tools of bioinformatics, we studied molecular networks involved in C9ALS pathology by focusing on C9orf72 omics datasets, such as proteome of C9orf72 repeat RNA-binding proteins, transcriptome of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived motor neurons of patients with C9ALS, and transcriptome of purified motor neurons of patients with C9ALS.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: We found that C9orf72 repeat RNA-binding proteins play a crucial role in the regulation of post-transcriptional RNA processing. The expression of a wide range of extracellular matrix proteins and matrix metalloproteinases was reduced in iPSC-derived motor neurons of patients with C9ALS. The regulation of RNA processing and cytoskeletal dynamics is disturbed in motor neurons of patients with C9ALS in vivo.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Bioinformatics data mining approach suggests a logical hypothesis that C9orf72 repeat expansions that deregulate post-transcriptional RNA processing disturb the homeostasis of cytoskeletal dynamics and remodeling of extracellular matrix, leading to degeneration of stress-vulnerable neurons in the brain and spinal cord of patients with C9ALS.},

With intensive effort made during the last two decades, numerous genes and mutations have been published to be associated with the disease. An organized resource integrating and annotating the ever-increasing genetic data will be imperative to acquire a global view of the cutting-edge in epilepsy research. Herein, we developed EpilepsyGene (http://61.152.91.49/EpilepsyGene). It contains cumulative to date 499 genes and 3931 variants associated with 331 clinical phenotypes collected from 818 publications. Furthermore, in-depth data mining was performed to gain insights into the understanding of the data, including functional annotation, gene prioritization, functional analysis of prioritized genes and overlap analysis focusing on the comorbidity. An intuitive web interface to search and browse the diversified genetic data was also developed to facilitate access to the data of interest. In general, EpilepsyGene is designed to be a central genetic database to provide the research community substantial convenience to uncover the genetic basis of epilepsy.},

  abstract = {We developed a new computational technique called Step-Level Differential Response (SLDR) to identify genetic regulatory relationships. Our technique takes advantages of functional genomics data for the same species under different perturbation conditions, therefore complementary to current popular computational techniques. It can particularly identify "rare" activation/inhibition relationship events that can be difficult to find in experimental results. In SLDR, we model each candidate target gene as being controlled by N binary-state regulators that lead to {$\leq$}2N observable states ("step-levels") for the target. We applied SLDR to the study of the GEO microarray data set GSE25644, which consists of 158 different mutant S. cerevisiae gene expressional profiles. For each target gene t, we first clustered ordered samples into various clusters, each approximating an observable step-level of t to screen out the "de-centric" target. Then, we ordered each gene x as a candidate regulator and aligned t to x for the purpose of examining the step-level correlations between low expression set of x (Ro) and high expression set of x (Rh) from the regulator x to t, by finding max f(t, x): |Ro-Rh| over all candidate \texttimes{} in the genome for each t. We therefore obtained activation and inhibitions events from different combinations of Ro and Rh. Furthermore, we developed criteria for filtering out less-confident regulators, estimated the number of regulators for each target t, and evaluated identified top-ranking regulator-target relationship. Our results can be cross-validated with the Yeast Fitness database. SLDR is also computationally efficient with o(N2) complexity. In summary, we believe SLDR can be applied to the mining of functional genomics big data for future network biology and network medicine applications.},

We integrate chromatin conformation capture data (HiC) with literature support to rank putative target genes of intergenic disease-associated SNPs. We demonstrate that this hybrid method outperforms a genomic distance baseline on a small test set of expression quantitative trait loci, as well as either method individually. In addition, we show the potential for this method to uncover relationships between intergenic SNPs and target genes across chromosomes. With more extensive chromatin conformation capture data becoming readily available, this method provides a way forward towards functional interpretation of SNPs in the context of the three dimensional structure of the genome in the nucleus.},

  abstract = {BackgroundNear universal administration of vaccines mandates intense pharmacovigilance for vaccine safety and a stringently low tolerance for adverse events. Reports of autoimmune diseases (AID) following vaccination have been challenging to evaluate given the high rates of vaccination, background incidence of autoimmunity, and low incidence and variable times for onset of AID after vaccinations. In order to identify biologically plausible pathways to adverse autoimmune events of vaccine-related AID, we used a systems biology approach to create a matrix of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms active in specific diseases, responses to vaccine antigens, adjuvants, preservatives and stabilizers, for the most common vaccine-associated AID found in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.ResultsThis report focuses on Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and Idiopathic (or immune) Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). Multiple curated databases and automated text mining of PubMed literature identified 667 genes associated with RA, 448 with SLE, 49 with ITP and 73 with GBS. While all data sources provided valuable and unique gene associations, text mining using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms provided the most information but required curation to remove incorrect associations. Six genes were associated with all four AIDs. Thirty-three pathways were shared by the four AIDs. Classification of genes into twelve immune system related categories identified more \textquestiondown{}Th17 T-cell subtype\textquestiondown{} genes in RA than the other AIDs, and more \textquestiondown{}Chemokine plus Receptors\textquestiondown{} genes associated with RA than SLE. Gene networks were visualized and clustered into interconnected modules with specific gene clusters for each AID, including one in RA with ten C-X-C motif chemokines. The intersection of genes associated with GBS, GBS peptide auto-antigens, influenza A infection, and influenza vaccination created a subnetwork of genes that inferred a possible role for the MAPK signaling pathway in influenza vaccine related GBS.ConclusionsResults showing unique and common gene sets, pathways, immune system categories and functional clusters of genes in four autoimmune diseases suggest it is possible to develop molecular classifications of autoimmune and inflammatory events. Combining this information with cellular and other disease responses should greatly aid in the assessment of potential immune-mediated adverse events following vaccination.},

Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells and, more recently, C2C12 myocytes and myotubes have emerged as popular models for investigating the cellular biology of PrP. Mouse epithelial NMuMG cells might become attractive models for studying the possible involvement of PrP in a morphogenetic program underlying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions. Here we describe the generation of PrP knockout clones from these cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout technology. More specifically, knockout clones were generated with two separate guide RNAs targeting recognition sites on opposite strands within the first hundred nucleotides of the Prnp coding sequence. Several PrP knockout clones were isolated and genomic insertions and deletions near the CRISPR-target sites were characterized. Subsequently, deep quantitative global proteome analyses that recorded the relative abundance of{$>$}3000 proteins (data deposited to ProteomeXchange Consortium) were undertaken to begin to characterize the molecular consequences of PrP deficiency. The levels of {$\sim$}120 proteins were shown to reproducibly correlate with the presence or absence of PrP, with most of these proteins belonging to extracellular components, cell junctions or the cytoskeleton.},

  abstract = {To date, anticonvulsant effects of the plant cannabinoid, cannabidivarin (CBDV), have been reported in several animal models of seizure. However, these behaviourally observed anticonvulsant effects have not been confirmed at the molecular level. To examine changes to epilepsy-related gene expression following chemical convulsant treatment and their subsequent control by phytocannabinoid administration, we behaviourally evaluated effects of CBDV (400 mg/kg, p.o.) on acute, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ: 95 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced seizures, quantified expression levels of several epilepsy-related genes (Fos, Casp 3, Ccl3, Ccl4, Npy, Arc, Penk, Camk2a, Bdnf and Egr1) by qPCR using hippocampal, neocortical and prefrontal cortical tissue samples before examining correlations between expression changes and seizure severity. PTZ treatment alone produced generalised seizures (median: 5.00) and significantly increased expression of Fos, Egr1, Arc, Ccl4 and Bdnf. Consistent with previous findings, CBDV significantly decreased PTZ-induced seizure severity (median: 3.25) and increased latency to the first sign of seizure. Furthermore, there were correlations between reductions of seizure severity and mRNA expression of Fos, Egr1, Arc, Ccl4 and Bdnf in the majority of brain regions in the CBDV+PTZ treated group. When CBDV treated animals were grouped into CBDV responders (criterion: seizure severity {$\leq$}3.25) and non-responders (criterion: seizure severity {$>$}3.25), PTZ-induced increases of Fos, Egr1, Arc, Ccl4 and Bdnf expression were suppressed in CBDV responders. These results provide the first molecular confirmation of behaviourally observed effects of the non-psychoactive, anticonvulsant cannabinoid, CBDV, upon chemically-induced seizures and serve to underscore its suitability for clinical development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Epilepsy is the most prevalent neurological disease and is characterized by recurrent seizures. Here, we investigate (i) the anticonvulsant profiles of cannabis-derived botanical drug substances (BDSs) rich in cannabidivarin (CBDV) and containing cannabidiol (CBD) in acute in vivo seizure models and (ii) the binding of CBDV BDSs and their components at cannabinoid CB1 receptors.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The anticonvulsant profiles of two CBDV BDSs (50-422\,mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) ) were evaluated in three animal models of acute seizure. Purified CBDV and CBD were also evaluated in an isobolographic study to evaluate potential pharmacological interactions. CBDV BDS effects on motor function were also investigated using static beam and grip strength assays. Binding of CBDV BDSs to cannabinoid CB1 receptors was evaluated using displacement binding assays.

KEY RESULTS: CBDV BDSs exerted significant anticonvulsant effects in the pentylenetetrazole ({$\geq$}100\,mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) ) and audiogenic seizure models ({$\geq$}87\,mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) ), and suppressed pilocarpine-induced convulsions ({$\geq$}100\,mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) ). The isobolographic study revealed that the anticonvulsant effects of purified CBDV and CBD were linearly additive when co-administered. Some motor effects of CBDV BDSs were observed on static beam performance; no effects on grip strength were found. The {$\Delta$}(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol and {$\Delta$}(9) -tetrahydrocannabivarin content of CBDV BDS accounted for its greater affinity for CB1 cannabinoid receptors than purified CBDV.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: CBDV BDSs exerted significant anticonvulsant effects in three models of seizure that were not mediated by the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and were of comparable efficacy with purified CBDV. These findings strongly support the further clinical development of CBDV BDSs for the treatment of epilepsy.},

  doi = {10.1186/1471-2202-14-38},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cortical cultures grown long-term on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) are frequently and extensively used as models of cortical networks in studies of neuronal firing activity, neuropharmacology, toxicology and mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity. However, in contrast to the predominantly asynchronous neuronal firing activity exhibited by intact cortex, electrophysiological activity of mature cortical cultures is dominated by spontaneous epileptiform-like global burst events which hinders their effective use in network-level studies, particularly for neurally-controlled animat ('artificial animal') applications. Thus, the identification of culture features that can be exploited to produce neuronal activity more representative of that seen in vivo could increase the utility and relevance of studies that employ these preparations. Acetylcholine has a recognised neuromodulatory role affecting excitability, rhythmicity, plasticity and information flow in vivo although its endogenous production by cortical cultures and subsequent functional influence upon neuronal excitability remains unknown.

RESULTS: Consequently, using MEA electrophysiological recording supported by immunohistochemical and RT-qPCR methods, we demonstrate for the first time, the presence of intrinsic cholinergic neurons and significant, endogenous cholinergic tone in cortical cultures with a characterisation of the muscarinic and nicotinic components that underlie modulation of spontaneous neuronal activity. We found that tonic muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) activation affects global excitability and burst event regularity in a culture age-dependent manner whilst, in contrast, tonic nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) activation can modulate burst duration and the proportion of spikes occurring within bursts in a spatio-temporal fashion.

CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the presence of significant endogenous cholinergic tone in cortical cultures and the comparability of its modulatory effects to those seen in intact brain tissues support emerging, exploitable commonalities between in vivo and in vitro preparations. We conclude that experimental manipulation of endogenous cholinergic tone could offer a novel opportunity to improve the use of cortical cultures for studies of network-level mechanisms in a manner that remains largely consistent with its functional role.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Phytocannabinoids in Cannabis sativa have diverse pharmacological targets extending beyond cannabinoid receptors and several exert notable anticonvulsant effects. For the first time, we investigated the anticonvulsant profile of the phytocannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) in vitro and in in vivo seizure models.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effect of CBDV (1-100 {$\mu$}M) on epileptiform local field potentials (LFPs) induced in rat hippocampal brain slices by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) application or Mg(2+) -free conditions was assessed by in vitro multi-electrode array recordings. Additionally, the anticonvulsant profile of CBDV (50-200 mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) ) in vivo was investigated in four rodent seizure models: maximal electroshock (mES) and audiogenic seizures in mice, and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats. The effects of CBDV in combination with commonly used antiepileptic drugs on rat seizures were investigated. Finally, the motor side effect profile of CBDV was investigated using static beam and grip strength assays.

KEY RESULTS: CBDV significantly attenuated status epilepticus-like epileptiform LFPs induced by 4-AP and Mg(2+) -free conditions. CBDV had significant anticonvulsant effects on the mES ({$\geq$}100 mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) ), audiogenic ({$\geq$}50 mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) ) and PTZ-induced seizures ({$\geq$}100 mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) ). CBDV (200 mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) ) alone had no effect against pilocarpine-induced seizures, but significantly attenuated these seizures when administered with valproate or phenobarbital at this dose. CBDV had no effect on motor function.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results indicate that CBDV is an effective anticonvulsant in a broad range of seizure models. Also it did not significantly affect normal motor function and, therefore, merits further investigation as a novel anti-epileptic in chronic epilepsy models.

  abstract = {Cannabis sativa has been associated with contradictory effects upon seizure states despite its medicinal use by numerous people with epilepsy. We have recently shown that the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) reduces seizure severity and lethality in the well-established in vivo model of pentylenetetrazole-induced generalised seizures, suggesting that earlier, small-scale clinical trials examining CBD effects in people with epilepsy warrant renewed attention. Here, we report the effects of pure CBD (1, 10 and 100mg/kg) in two other established rodent seizure models, the acute pilocarpine model of temporal lobe seizure and the penicillin model of partial seizure. Seizure activity was video recorded and scored offline using model-specific seizure severity scales. In the pilocarpine model CBD (all doses) significantly reduced the percentage of animals experiencing the most severe seizures. In the penicillin model, CBD ({$\geq$} 10 mg/kg) significantly decreased the percentage mortality as a result of seizures; CBD (all doses) also decreased the percentage of animals experiencing the most severe tonic-clonic seizures. These results extend the anti-convulsant profile of CBD; when combined with a reported absence of psychoactive effects, this evidence strongly supports CBD as a therapeutic candidate for a diverse range of human epilepsies.},

  abstract = {Cerebellar ataxias are a group of progressive, debilitating diseases often associated with abnormal Purkinje cell (PC) firing and/or degeneration. Many animal models of cerebellar ataxia display abnormalities in Ca{$^2^{+}$} channel function. The 'ducky' du(2J) mouse model of ataxia and absence epilepsy represents a clean knock-out of the auxiliary Ca{$^2^{+}$} channel subunit {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-2, and has been associated with deficient Ca{$^2^{+}$} channel function in the cerebellar cortex. Here, we investigate effects of du(2J) mutation on PC layer (PCL) and granule cell layer (GCL) neuronal spiking activity and, also, inhibitory neurotransmission at interneurone-Purkinje cell (IN-PC) synapses. Increased neuronal firing irregularity was seen in the PCL and, to a less marked extent, in the GCL in du(2J)/du(2J), but not +/du(2J), mice; these data suggest that the ataxic phenotype is associated with lack of precision of PC firing, that may also impinge on GC activity and requires expression of two du(2J) alleles to manifest fully. The du(2J) mutation had no clear effect on spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequency at IN-PC synapses, but was associated with increased sIPSC amplitudes. du(2J) mutation ablated cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R)-mediated modulation of spontaneous neuronal spike firing and CB1R-mediated presynaptic inhibition of synaptic transmission at IN-PC synapses in both +/du(2J) and du(2J)/du(2J) mutants, effects that occurred in the absence of changes in CB1R expression. These results demonstrate that the du(2J) ataxia model is associated with deficient CB1R signalling in the cerebellar cortex, putatively linked with compromised Ca{$^2^{+}$} channel activity and the ataxic phenotype.},

A global, integrative, approach has been developed for several years, including protein-protein interaction networks (interactomes). In this review, we describe the high-throughput methods used to identify new interactions and to build large interaction datasets. The minimum information required for reporting a molecular interaction experiment (MIMIx) has been defined as a standard for storing data in publicly available interaction databases. Several examples of interaction networks from molecular machines (proteasome) or organelles (phagosome, mitochondrion) to whole organisms (viruses, bacteria, yeast, fly, and worm) are given and attempts to cover the entire human interaction network are discussed. The methods used to perform the topological analysis of interaction networks and to extract biological information from them are presented. These investigations have provided clues on protein functions, signalling and metabolic pathways, and physiological processes, unraveled the molecular basis of some diseases (cancer, infectious diseases), and will be very useful to identify new therapeutic targets and for drug discovery. A major challenge is now to integrate data from different sources (interactome, transcriptome, phenome, localization) to switch from static to dynamic interaction networks. The merging of a viral interactome and the human interactome has been used to simulate viral infection, paving the way for future studies aiming at providing molecular basis of human diseases.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, known together as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are severe autoimmune disorders now causing gut inflammation and ulceration, among other symptoms, in up to 1 in 250 people worldwide. Incidence and prevalence of IBD have been increasing dramatically over the past several decades, although the causes for this increase are still unknown. IBD has both a complex genotype and a complex phenotype, and although it has received substantial attention from the medical research community over recent years, much of the etiology remains unexplained. Genome-wide association studies have identified a rich genetic signature of disease risk in patients with IBD, consisting of at least 163 genetic loci. Many of these loci contain genes directly involved in microbial handling, indicating that the genetic architecture of the disease has been driven by host-microbe interactions. In addition, systematic shifts in gut microbiome structure (enterotype) and function have been observed in patients with IBD. Furthermore, both the host genotype and enterotype are associated with aspects of the disease phenotype, including location of the disease. This provides strong evidence of interactions between host genotype and enterotype; however, there is a lack of published multi-omics data from IBD patients, and a lack of bioinformatics tools for modeling such systems. In this article we discuss, from a computational biologist's point of view, the potential benefits of and the challenges involved in designing and analyzing such multi-omics studies of IBD.},

A small and poorly defined role for dysbiosis in the development of IBS symptoms has been established through characterization of altered intestinal microbiota in IBS patients and reported improvement of subjective symptoms after its manipulation with prebiotics, probiotics, or antibiotics. It remains to be determined whether IBS symptoms are caused by alterations in brain signaling from the intestine to the microbiota or primary disruption of the microbiota, and whether they are involved in altered interactions between the brain and intestine during development. We review the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBS in different groups of patients. Studies are needed to better characterize alterations to the intestinal microbiome in large cohorts of well-phenotyped patients, and to correlate intestinal metabolites with specific abnormalities in gut-brain interactions.},

A decade of genome-wide association studies and other genetic analyses have linked IBD with loci that implicate an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota. More recently, profiling studies of the intestinal microbiome have associated the pathogenesis of IBD with characteristic shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, reinforcing the view that IBD results from altered interactions between intestinal microbes and the mucosal immune system. Enhanced technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level. We review important microbiome studies of patients with IBD and describe what we have learned about the mechanisms of intestinal microbiota dysfunction. We describe the recent progress in microbiome research from exploratory 16S-based studies, reporting associations of specific organisms with a disease, to more recent studies that have taken a more nuanced view, addressing the function of the microbiota by metagenomic and metabolomic methods. Finally, we propose study designs and methodologies for future investigations of the microbiome in patients with inflammatory gut and autoimmune diseases in general.},

  abstract = {Respiratory diseases are multifactorial heterogeneous diseases that have proved recalcitrant to understanding using focused molecular techniques. This trend has led to the rise of 'omics approaches (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) and subsequent acquisition of large-scale datasets consisting of multiple variables. In 'omics technology-based investigations, discrepancies between the number of variables analyzed (e.g., mRNA, proteins, metabolites) and the number of study subjects constitutes a major statistical challenge. The application of traditional univariate statistical methods (e.g., t-test) to these "short-and-wide" datasets may result in high numbers of false positives, while the predominant approach of p-value correction to account for these high false positive rates (e.g., FDR, Bonferroni) are associated with significant losses in statistical power. In other words, the benefit in decreased false positives must be counterbalanced with a concomitant loss in true positives. As an alternative, multivariate statistical analysis (MVA) is increasingly being employed to cope with 'omics-based data structures. When properly applied, MVA approaches can be powerful tools for integration and interpretation of complex 'omics-based datasets towards the goal of identifying biomarkers and/or subphenotypes. However, MVA methods are also prone to over-interpretation and misuse. A common software used in biomedical research to perform MVA-based analyses is the SIMCA package, which includes multiple MVA methods. In this opinion piece, we propose guidelines for minimum reporting standards for a SIMCA-based workflow, in terms of data preprocessing (e.g., normalization, scaling) and model statistics (number of components, R2, Q2, and CV-ANOVA p-value). Examples of these applications in recent COPD and asthma studies are provided. It is expected that readers will gain an increased understanding of the power and utility of MVA methods for applications in biomedical research.},

CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and plays diverse roles in gene regulation, imprinting, insulation, intra/interchromosomal interactions, nuclear compartmentalisation, and alternative splicing. CTCF has a single paralogue, the testes-specific CTCF-like gene (CTCFL)/BORIS. CTCF and BORIS can be deregulated in cancer. The tumour suppressor gene CTCF can be mutated or deleted in cancer, or CTCF DNA binding can be altered by epigenetic changes. BORIS is aberrantly expressed frequently in cancer, leading some to propose a pro-tumourigenic role for BORIS. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation.},

  abstract = {After more than two decades of rising rates, in recent years the total kidney cancer incidence worldwide has shown signs of stabilizing, or even decreasing. In adults, kidney cancer consists of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the predominant form, and renal transitional cell carcinoma (RTCC); these types primarily arise in the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis, respectively. Although temporal trends by kidney cancer type are not well established worldwide, incidence of RCC in the US has continued to rise, mainly for early-stage tumors, while that of RTCC has declined, and total kidney cancer mortality rates have leveled. Stabilization of kidney cancer mortality rates has also been reported in Europe. These trends are consistent with reports of increasing incidental diagnoses and a downward shift in tumor stage and size in clinical series. The changing prevalence of known risk factors for RCC, including cigarette smoking, obesity, and hypertension, is also likely to affect incidence trends, although their relative impact may differ between populations. Accumulating evidence suggests an etiologic role in RCC for physical activity, alcohol consumption, occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, and high parity among women, but further research is needed into the potential causal effects of these factors. Genetic factors and their interaction with environmental exposures are believed to influence risk of developing RCC, but a limited number of studies using candidate-gene approaches have not produced conclusive results. Large consortium efforts employing genome-wide scanning technology are underway, which hold promise for novel discoveries in renal carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As we enter an era when testing millions of SNPs in a single gene association study will become the standard, consideration of multiple comparisons is an essential part of determining statistical significance. Bonferroni adjustments can be made but are conservative due to the preponderance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers, and permutation testing is not always a viable option. Three major classes of corrections have been proposed to correct the dependent nature of genetic data in Bonferroni adjustments: permutation testing and related alternatives, principal components analysis (PCA), and analysis of blocks of LD across the genome. We consider seven implementations of these commonly used methods using data from 1514 European American participants genotyped for 700,078 SNPs in a GWAS for AIDS.

RESULTS: A Bonferroni correction using the number of LD blocks found by the three algorithms implemented by Haploview resulted in an insufficiently conservative threshold, corresponding to a genome-wide significance level of {$\alpha$} = 0.15 - 0.20. We observed a moderate increase in power when using PRESTO, SLIDE, and simple{$\mathscr{M}$} when compared with traditional Bonferroni methods for population data genotyped on the Affymetrix 6.0 platform in European Americans ({$\alpha$} = 0.05 thresholds between 1 \texttimes{} 10(-7) and 7 \texttimes{} 10(-8)).

CONCLUSIONS: Correcting for the number of LD blocks resulted in an anti-conservative Bonferroni adjustment. SLIDE and simple{$\mathscr{M}$} are particularly useful when using a statistical test not handled in optimized permutation testing packages, and genome-wide corrected p-values using SLIDE, are much easier to interpret for consumers of GWAS studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading genetically complex and heterogeneous disorder that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying risk factors remain largely unclear for this heterogeneous disorder. In recent years, high throughput methodologies, such as genome-wide linkage analysis (GWL), genome-wide association (GWA) studies, and genome-wide expression profiling (GWE), have led to the identification of several candidate genes associated with AD. However, due to lack of consistency within their findings, an integrative approach is warranted. Here, we have designed a rank based gene prioritization approach involving convergent analysis of multi-dimensional data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network modelling.

RESULTS: Our approach employs integration of three different AD datasets- GWL,GWA and GWE to identify overlapping candidate genes ranked using a novel cumulative rank score (SR) based method followed by prioritization using clusters derived from PPI network. SR for each gene is calculated by addition of rank assigned to individual gene based on either p value or score in three datasets. This analysis yielded 108 plausible AD genes. Network modelling by creating PPI using proteins encoded by these genes and their direct interactors resulted in a layered network of 640 proteins. Clustering of these proteins further helped us in identifying 6 significant clusters with 7 proteins (EGFR, ACTB, CDC2, IRAK1, APOE, ABCA1 and AMPH) forming the central hub nodes. Functional annotation of 108 genes revealed their role in several biological activities such as neurogenesis, regulation of MAP kinase activity, response to calcium ion, endocytosis paralleling the AD specific attributes. Finally, 3 potential biochemical biomarkers were found from the overlap of 108~AD proteins with proteins from CSF and plasma proteome. EGFR and ACTB were found to be the two most significant AD risk genes.

CONCLUSIONS: With the assumption that common genetic signals obtained from different methodological platforms might serve as robust AD risk markers than candidates identified using single dimension approach, here we demonstrated an integrated genomic convergence approach for disease candidate gene prioritization from heterogeneous data sources linked to AD.},

The different steps of this protocol are illustrated on a real-life data application for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2259 patients and 6017 controls from France). Particularly, in the exhaustive genome-wide epistasis screening we identified AD-associated interacting SNPs-pair from chromosome 6q11.1 (rs6455128, the KHDRBS2 gene) and 13q12.11 (rs7989332, the CRYL1 gene) (p = 0.006, corrected for multiple testing). A replication analysis in the independent AD cohort from Germany (555 patients and 824 controls) confirmed the discovered epistasis signal (p = 0.036). This signal was also supported by a meta-analysis approach in 5 independent AD cohorts that was applied in the context of epistasis for the first time. Transcriptome analysis revealed negative correlation between expression levels of KHDRBS2 and CRYL1 in both the temporal cortex ({$\beta$} = -0.19, p = 0.0006) and cerebellum ({$\beta$} = -0.23, p {$<$} 0.0001) brain regions.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report the genome-wide significant and/or replicable risk variants for alcohol dependence and explore their potential biological functions.

METHODS: We searched in PubMed for all genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of alcohol dependence. The following three types of the results were extracted: genome-wide significant associations in an individual sample, the combined samples, or the meta-analysis (p\,{$<$}\,5\,\texttimes\,10(-8) ); top-ranked associations in an individual sample (p\,{$<$}\,10(-5) ) that were nominally replicated in other samples (p\,{$<$}\,.05); and nominally replicable associations across at least three independent GWAS samples (p\,{$<$}\,.05). These results were meta-analyzed. cis-eQTLs in human, RNA expression in rat and mouse brains and bioinformatics properties of all of these risk variants were analyzed.

RESULTS: The variants located within the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) cluster were significantly associated with alcohol dependence at the genome-wide level (p\,{$<$}\,5\,\texttimes\,10(-8) ) in at least one sample. Some associations with the ADH cluster were replicable across six independent GWAS samples. The variants located within or near SERINC2, KIAA0040, MREG-PECR or PKNOX2 were significantly associated with alcohol dependence at the genome-wide level (p\,{$<$}\,5\,\texttimes\,10(-8) ) in meta-analysis or combined samples, and these associations were replicable across at least one sample. The associations with the variants within NRD1, GPD1L-CMTM8 or MAP3K9-PCNX were suggestive (5\,\texttimes\,10(-8) \,{$<$}\,p\,{$<$}\,10(-5) ) in some samples, and nominally replicable in other samples. The associations with the variants at HTR7 and OPA3 were nominally replicable across at least three independent GWAS samples (10(-5) \,{$<$}\,p\,{$<$}\,.05). Some risk variants at the ADH cluster, SERINC2, KIAA0040, NRD1, and HTR7 had potential biological functions.

CONCLUSION: The most robust risk locus was the ADH cluster. SERINC2, KIAA0040, NRD1, and HTR7 were also likely to play important roles in alcohol dependence. PKNOX2, MREG, PECR, GPD1L, CMTM8, MAP3K9, PCNX, and OPA3 might play less important roles in risk for alcohol dependence based on the function analysis. This conclusion will significantly contribute to the post-GWAS follow-up studies on alcohol dependence.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression data exhibit common information over the genome. This article shows how data can be analysed from an efficient whole-genome perspective. Further, the methods have been developed so that users with limited expertise in bioinformatics and statistical computing techniques could use and modify this procedure to their own needs. The method outlined first uses a large-scale linear mixed model for the expression data genome-wide, and then uses finite mixture models to separate differentially expressed (DE) from non-DE transcripts. These methods are illustrated through application to an exceptional UK Brain Expression Consortium involving 12 human frozen post-mortem brain regions.

RESULTS: Fitting linear mixed models has allowed variation in gene expression between different biological states (e.g. brain regions, gender, age) to be investigated. The model can be extended to allow for differing levels of variation between different biological states. Predicted values of the random effects show the effects of each transcript in a particular biological state. Using the UK Brain Expression Consortium data, this approach yielded striking patterns of co-regional gene expression. Fitting the finite mixture model to the effects within each state provides a convenient method to filter transcripts that are DE: these DE transcripts can then be extracted for advanced functional analysis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic risk scores have been developed for coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis, but are not predictive of adverse cardiovascular events. We asked whether peripheral blood expression profiles may be predictive of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and/or cardiovascular death.

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 338 subjects aged 62\,{$\pm$}\,11 years with coronary artery disease (CAD) were analyzed in two phases (discovery N\,=\,175, and replication N\,=\,163), and followed for a mean 2.4 years for cardiovascular death. Gene expression was measured on Illumina HT-12 microarrays with two different normalization procedures to control technical and biological covariates. Whole genome genotyping was used to support comparative genome-wide association studies of gene expression. Analysis of variance was combined with receiver operating curve and survival analysis to define a transcriptional signature of cardiovascular death.

RESULTS: In both phases, there was significant differential expression between healthy and AMI groups with overall down-regulation of genes involved in T-lymphocyte signaling and up-regulation of inflammatory genes. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis provided evidence for altered local genetic regulation of transcript abundance in AMI samples. On follow-up there were 31 cardiovascular deaths. A principal component (PC1) score capturing covariance of 238 genes that were differentially expressed between deceased and survivors in the discovery phase significantly predicted risk of cardiovascular death in the replication and combined samples (hazard ratio\,=\,8.5, P\,{$<$}\,0.0001) and improved the C-statistic (area under the curve 0.82 to 0.91, P\,=\,0.03) after adjustment for traditional covariates.

CONCLUSIONS: A specific blood gene expression profile is associated with a significant risk of death in Caucasian subjects with CAD. This comprises a subset of transcripts that are also altered in expression during acute myocardial infarction.},

  abstract = {Pediatric lymphoid leukemia has the highest cure rate of all pediatric malignancies, yet due to its prevalence, still accounts for the majority of childhood cancer deaths and requires long-term highly toxic therapy. The ability to target B-cell ALL with immunoglobulin-like binders, whether anti-CD22 antibody or anti-CD19 CAR-Ts, has impacted treatment options for some patients. The development of new ways to target B-cell antigens continues at rapid pace. T-cell ALL accounts for up to 20\% of childhood leukemia but has yet to see a set of high-value immunotherapeutic targets identified. To find new targets for T-ALL immunotherapy, we employed a bioinformatic comparison to broad normal tissue arrays, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), and mature lymphocytes, then filtered the results for transcripts encoding plasma membrane proteins. T-ALL bears a core T-cell signature and transcripts encoding TCR/CD3 components and canonical markers of T-cell development predominate, especially when comparison was made to normal tissue or HSC. However, when comparison to mature lymphocytes was also undertaken, we identified two antigens that may drive, or be associated with leukemogenesis; TALLA-1 and hedgehog interacting protein. In addition, TCR subfamilies, CD1, activation and adhesion markers, membrane-organizing molecules, and receptors linked to metabolism and inflammation were also identified. Of these, only CD52, CD37, and CD98 are currently being targeted clinically. This work provides a set of targets to be considered for future development of immunotherapies for T-ALL.},

Every year, data collected from biomedical and behavioral science is getting larger and more complicated. Thus, in medicine, we also need to be aware of this trend and understand the statistical tools that are available to analyze these datasets. Many statistical analyses that are aimed to analyze such big datasets have been introduced recently. However, given many different types of clinical, genomic, and environmental data, it is rather uncommon to see statistical methods that combine knowledge resulting from those different data types. To this extent, we will introduce big data in terms of clinical data, single nucleotide polymorphism and gene expression studies and their interactions with environment. In this article, we will introduce the concept of well-known regression analyses such as linear and logistic regressions that has been widely used in clinical data analyses and modern statistical models such as Bayesian networks that has been introduced to analyze more complicated data. Also we will discuss how to represent the interaction among clinical, genomic, and environmental data in using modern statistical models. We conclude this article with a promising modern statistical method called Bayesian networks that is suitable in analyzing big data sets that consists with different type of large data from clinical, genomic, and environmental data. Such statistical model form big data will provide us with more comprehensive understanding of human physiology and disease.},

The advances in understanding protein structure and function, in no insignificant part a result of directed evolution studies, are increasingly empowering scientists and engineers to device more effective methods for manipulating and tailoring biocatalysts. Abandoning large combinatorial libraries, the focus has shifted to small, functionally rich libraries and rational design. A critical component to the success of these emerging engineering strategies are computational tools for the evaluation of protein sequence datasets and the analysis of conformational variations of amino acids in proteins. Highlighting the opportunities and limitations of such approaches, this review focuses on recent engineering and design examples that require screening or selection of small libraries.},

  abstract = {Prominent models of attentional control assert a dichotomy between top-down and bottom-up control, with the former determined by current selection goals and the latter determined by physical salience. This theoretical dichotomy, however, fails to explain a growing number of cases in which neither current goals nor physical salience can account for strong selection biases. For example, equally salient stimuli associated with reward can capture attention, even when this contradicts current selection goals. Thus, although 'top-down' sources of bias are sometimes defined as those that are not due to physical salience, this conception conflates distinct - and sometimes contradictory - sources of selection bias. We describe an alternative framework, in which past selection history is integrated with current goals and physical salience to shape an integrated priority map. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {What distinguishes the locations that we fixate from those that we do not? To answer this question we recorded eye movements while observers viewed natural scenes, and recorded image characteristics centred at the locations that observers fixated. To investigate potential differences in the visual characteristics of fixated versus non-fixated locations, these images were transformed to make intensity, contrast, colour, and edge content explicit. Signal detection and information theoretic techniques were then used to compare fixated regions to those that were not. The presence of contrast and edge information was more strongly discriminatory than luminance or chromaticity. Fixated locations tended to be more distinctive in the high spatial frequencies. Extremes of low frequency luminance information were avoided. With prolonged viewing, consistency in fixation locations between observers decreased. In contrast to [Parkhurst, D. J., Law, K., \& Niebur, E. (2002). Modeling the role of salience in the allocation of overt visual attention. Vision Research, 42 (1), 107-123] we found no change in the involvement of image features over time. We attribute this difference in our results to a systematic bias in their metric. We propose that saccade target selection involves an unchanging intermediate level representation of the scene but that the high-level interpretation of this representation changes over time. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Human eye movements were recorded while participants viewed a series of digitized images of complex natural and artificial scenes. Stimulus dependence of attention, as measured by the correlation between computed stimulus salience and fixation locations, was found to be significantly greater than that expected by chance alone and furthermore was greatest for eye movements that immediately follow stimulus onset. The ability to guide attention of three modeled stimulus features (color, intensity and orientation) was examined and found to vary with image type. Additionally, the effect of the drop in visual sensitivity as a function of eccentricity on stimulus salience was examined, modeled, and shown to be an important determiner of attentional allocation. Overall, the results indicate that stimulus-driven, bottom-up mechanisms contribute significantly to attentional guidance under natural viewing conditions. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {The relationship between saccadic eye movements and covert orienting or visual spatial attention was investigated in two experiments. In the first experiment, subjects were required to make a saccade to a specified location while also detecting a visual target presented just prior to the eye movement. Detection accuracy was highest when the location of the target coincided with the location of the saccade, suggesting that subjects use spatial attention in the programming and/or execution of saccadic eye movements. In the second experiment, subjects were explicitly directed to attend to a particular location and to make a saccade to the same location or to a different one. Superior target detection occurred at the saccade location regardless of attention instructions. This finding shows that subjects cannot move their eyes to one location and attend to a different one. The result of these experiments suggest that visuospatial attention is an important mechanism in generating voluntary saccadic eye movements.},

  abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

Molecular imaging by mass spectrometry is one such growth area. The development of a capability for 2D chemical imaging of surfaces is described, based on the combination of a desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) ion source with an automated surface stage capable of x, y translational motion. The lateral resolution of this new system is found to be less than 200 microns, using a test ink pattern. Chemical imaging of surfaces is demonstrated using model examples of organic and biological systems: (i) imaging of a 2D pattern written in different colored inks on photographic paper and (ii) imaging of thin coronal sections of rat brain tissue fixed onto a glass microscope slide. In both cases, full mass spectra are recorded as a function of x,y-position on the surface. In the chemical imaging example, the distributions of the two different inks on the paper surface were mapped by tracking the abundance of the intact organic cation which characterizes each particular ink dye. In the tissue imaging example, distributions of specific lipids in coronal sections of rat brain tissue were followed from the abundance distributions in 2D space of the deprotonated lipid molecules recorded in the negative ion mass spectra. These latter distributions reveal distinct anatomical features of the rat brain. The results of these studies demonstrate the feasibility of performing surface imaging studies using DESI and show that at this stage of its development it has a lateral spatial resolution of a few hundred microns. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This is largely due to the implementation of whole slide scanning, advances in software and computer processing capacity and the increasing importance of tissue-based research for biomarker discovery and stratified medicine. This review sets out the key application areas for digital pathology and image analysis, with a particular focus on research and biomarker discovery. A variety of image analysis applications are reviewed including nuclear morphometry and tissue architecture analysis, but with emphasis on immunohistochemistry and fluorescence analysis of tissue biomarkers. Digital pathology and image analysis have important roles across the drug/companion diagnostic development pipeline including biobanking, molecular pathology, tissue microarray analysis, molecular profiling of tissue and these important developments are reviewed. Underpinning all of these important developments is the need for high quality tissue samples and the impact of pre-analytical variables on tissue research is discussed. This requirement is combined with practical advice on setting up and running a digital pathology laboratory. Finally, we discuss the need to integrate digital image analysis data with epidemiological, clinical and genomic data in order to fully understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype and to drive discovery and the delivery of personalized medicine. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The morphological interpretation of histologic sections forms the basis of diagnosis and prognostication for cancer. In the diagnosis of carcinomas, pathologists perform a semiquantitative analysis of a small set of morphological features to determine the cancer's histologic grade. Physicians use histologic grade to inform their assessment of a carcinoma's aggressiveness and a patient's prognosis. Nevertheless, the determination of grade in breast cancer examines only a small set of morphological features of breast cancer epithelial cells, which has been largely unchanged since the 1920s. A comprehensive analysis of automatically quantitated morphological features could identify characteristics of prognostic relevance and provide an accurate and reproducible means for assessing prognosis from microscopic image data. We developed the C-Path (Computational Pathologist) system to measure a rich quantitative feature set from the breast cancer epithelium and stroma (6642 features), including both standard morphometric descriptors of image objects and higher-level contextual, relational, and global image features. These measurements were used to construct a prognostic model. We applied the C-Path system to microscopic images from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) cohort, n = 248, and the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) cohort, n = 328. The prognostic model score generated by our system was strongly associated with overall survival in both the NKI and the VGH cohorts (both log-rank P 0.001). This association was independent of clinical, pathological, and molecular factors. Three stromal features were significantly associated with survival, and this association was stronger than the association of survival with epithelial characteristics in the model. These findings implicate stromal morphologic structure as a previously unrecognized prognostic determinant for breast cancer.},

  doi = {10.1038/modpathol.2013.134},
  abstract = {Molecular pathology is becoming more and more important in present day pathology. A major challenge for any molecular test is its ability to reliably detect mutations in samples consisting of mixtures of tumor cells and normal cells, especially when the tumor content is low. The minimum percentage of tumor cells required to detect genetic abnormalities is a major variable. Information on tumor cell percentage is essential for a correct interpretation of the result. In daily practice, the percentage of tumor cells is estimated by pathologists on hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E)-stained slides, the reliability of which has been questioned. This study aimed to determine the reliability of estimated tumor cell percentages in tissue samples by pathologists. On 47 H\&E-stained slides of lung tumors a tumor area was marked. The percentage of tumor cells within this area was estimated independently by nine pathologists, using categories of 0-5\%, 6-10\%, 11-20\%, 21-30\%, and so on, until 91-100\%. As gold standard, the percentage of tumor cells was counted manually. On average, the range between the lowest and the highest estimate per sample was 6.3 categories. In 33\% of estimates, the deviation from the gold standard was at least three categories. The mean absolute deviation was 2.0 categories (range between observers 1.5-3.1 categories). There was a significant difference between the observers (P{$<$}0.001). If 20\% of tumor cells were considered the lower limit to detect a mutation, samples with an insufficient tumor cell percentage ({$<$}20\%) would have been estimated to contain enough tumor cells in 27/72 (38\%) observations, possibly causing false negative results. In conclusion, estimates of tumor cell percentages on H\&E-stained slides are not accurate, which could result in misinterpretation of test results. Reliability could possibly be improved by using a training set with feedback.},

DESIGN: Ten \texttimes{}20 magnification images of hematoxylin-eosin-stained colon tissue specimens were sent as an educational component of the College of American Pathologists KRAS-B 2011 Survey. Data from 194 labs were analyzed and compared to a criterion standard with comprehensive manual nuclear counts. RESULTS: Survey responses indicated low interlaboratory precision of pathologist estimation, but mean estimates were fairly accurate. A total of 5 of the 10 cases assessed showed more than 10\% of respondents overestimating in a manner that could lead to false-negative test results.

The most common method used is the H-score which takes into consideration the staining intensity in conjunction with the percentage of cells staining positively in breast carcinoma tissue. A "quickscore" has been developed which dispenses with the need to count individual cells. The quantitative biochemical Abbott enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and the Dako immunohistochemical assay (IHA) incorporating a semiquantitative H-score, have been used as standards against which the IHA quickscore for the semiquantitation of oestrogen receptor expression was tested. A good correlation was found between the quickscore and the EIA, which was as good as that between the H-score and EIA. The quickscore is a valid approach and there is no advantage in using the more rigorous H-score. A positive cut off quickscore of {$>$} or = 3 has been suggested.},

Quantitative estrogen receptor content was determined by dextran-coated charcoal analysis and sucrose density gradient analysis. In all cases H222 Sp gamma localized in the nucleus of target cells. A semiquantitative correlation existed between HSCORE and biochemical assays for breast and endometrial tissues. The sensitivities and specificities for HSCORE as compared to the biochemical assays ranged from 80 to 95\% and from 74 to 94\%, respectively. HSCORE correlated with tumor grade for breast and endometrial carcinoma. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed no specific staining in melanomas.

Image analysis was performed in mammographic regions that attracted radiologists' attention and in all abnormal regions. Machine learning algorithms were investigated to develop predictive models that link: (i) image content with gaze, (ii) image content and gaze with cognition, and (iii) image content, gaze, and cognition with diagnostic error. Both group-based and individualized models were explored.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: By pooling the data from all readers, machine learning produced highly accurate predictive models linking image content, gaze, and cognition. Potential linking of those with diagnostic error was also supported to some extent. Merging readers' gaze metrics and cognitive opinions with computer-extracted image features identified 59\% of the readers' diagnostic errors while confirming 97.3\% of their correct diagnoses. The readers' individual perceptual and cognitive behaviors could be adequately predicted by modeling the behavior of others. However, personalized tuning was in many cases beneficial for capturing more accurately individual behavior.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: There is clearly an interaction between radiologists' gaze, diagnostic decision, and image content which can be modeled with machine learning algorithms.},

Materials and Methods Institutional review board research ethics approval was granted to use anonymized computed tomographic (CT) colonographic data from previous studies and to obtain eye-tracking data from volunteers. Sixty-five radiologists (27 experienced, 38 inexperienced) interpreted 23 endoluminal 3D CT colonographic videos. Eye movements were recorded by using eye tracking with a desk-mounted tracker. Readers indicated when they saw a polyp by clicking a computer mouse. Polyp location and boundary on each video frame were quantified and gaze data were related to the polyp boundary for each individual reader and case. Predefined metrics were quantified and used to describe and compare visual search patterns between experienced and inexperienced readers by using multilevel modeling. Results Time to first pursuit was significantly shorter in experienced readers (hazard ratio, 1.22 [95\% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.44]; P = .017) but other metrics were not significantly different. Regardless of expertise, metrics such as assessment, identification period, and pursuit times were extended in videos where polyps were visible on screen for longer periods of time. In 97\% (760 of 787) of observations, readers correctly pursued polyps. Conclusion Experienced readers had shorter time to first eye pursuit, but many other characteristics of eye tracking were similar between experienced and inexperienced readers. Readers pursued polyps in 97\% of observations, which indicated that errors during interpretation of 3D CT colonography in this study occurred in either the discovery or the recognition phase, but rarely in the scanning phase of radiologic image inspection. \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2014.},

  abstract = {Purpose We compared performance and visual search parameters of radiologists detecting masses on mammograms by using both a head-mounted (HDMT) and a remote (REM) eye tracker. Materials and Methods Five experienced radiologists read twice a case set of 20 one-view (medial-lateral oblique) mammograms, of which 12 contained a malignant mass and eight were lesion-free. For each observer, one trial used an HDMT eye-tracking system and the other used an REM system. Trials were separated on average by 2 months. Time to hit the location of the mass, dwell, and number of fixations in the location of the mass were measured. The same parameters were measured on a per-trial basis to determine whether there were memory effects from the previous trial. Results Dwell times in the location of true-positive, false-positive, and false-negative results were significantly shorter (P {$<$} .05) using the HDMT (median, 0.395 seconds) than REM (median, 0.482 seconds) systems, but the number of fixations in the location of the response was smaller using the REM system (median, 4.33 versus 5.0 for the HDMT). The observed differences did not seem to be caused by a memory effect. In addition, the relative lack of head mobility using the REM system caused observers to report neck strain. Conclusion Overall, radiologists' visual search behavior was very similar using both types of eye-tracking device. However, because the REM system did not contain a magnetic head tracker, radiologists were allowed very limited head movements when using it, which made them uncomfortable during the experiment.},

The aim of this study was to establish the main pathologist's navigation patterns when exploring virtual microscopy slides, using a graphical user interface, adapted to the pathologist's workflow. Four pathologists with a similar level of experience, graduated from the same pathology program, navigated six virtual slides. Different issues were evaluated, namely, the percentage of common visited image regions, the time spent at each and its coincidence level, that is to say, the region of interest location. In addition, navigation patterns were also assessed, i.e., mouse movement velocities and linearity of the diagnostic paths. Results suggest that regions of interest are determined by a complex combination of the visited area, the time spent at each visit and the coincidence level among pathologists. Additionally, linear trajectories and particular velocity patterns were found for the registered diagnostic paths.},

The system was used to study two trainee and two expert pathologists diagnosing 60 Barrett's oesophageal biopsy specimens. Comparisons of the diagnostic tracks showed the reason for errors. Forty-six cases had an expert consensus diagnosis. The trainees made errors in 21 and 15 cases, respectively, of which 11 and nine were clinically significant. Errors were made across the whole spectrum of diagnoses from negative to intramucosal carcinoma. Detailed examination of the tracks showed that in all errors there was incorrect interpretation of information; in three errors there was an additional failure to identify diagnostic features. CONCLUSIONS: Tracking with virtual slides is a useful tool in studying diagnosis and error, which has the potential for use in training and assessment.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to examine and characterize changes in the ways that pathology residents examine digital whole slide images as they progress through the residency training. A series of 20 digitized breast biopsy whole slide images (half benign and half malignant biopsies) were individually shown to 4 pathology residents at four points in time - at the beginning of their first, second, third, and fourth years of residency. Their task was to examine each image and select three areas that they would most want to zoom in on in order to view the diagnostic detail at higher resolution. Eye position was recorded as they scanned each whole slide image at low magnification. The data indicate that with each successive year of experience, the residents' search patterns do change. Overall, with time, it takes significantly less time to view an individual slide and decide where to zoom, significantly fewer fixations are generated overall, and there is less examination of nondiagnostic areas. Essentially, the residents' search becomes much more efficient. These findings are similar to those in radiology, and support the theory that an important aspect of the development of expertise is improved pattern recognition (taking in more information during the initial Gestalt or gist view) as well as improved allocation of attention and visual processing resources. Progression in improvements in visual search strategies was similar, but not identical, for the 4 residents. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Brain CT images showing cerebrovascular accidents were presented to 12 neurologists and 12 control subjects. The subjects' ocular fixation positions were recorded using an eye-tracking device (Eyelink 1000). Heat maps were created based on the eye-fixation patterns of each group and compared between the two groups. The heat maps revealed that the areas on which control subjects frequently fixated often coincided with areas identified as outstanding in saliency maps, while the areas on which neurologists frequently fixated often did not. Dwell time in regions of interest (ROI) was likewise compared between the two groups, revealing that, although dwell time on large lesions was not different between the two groups, dwell time in clinically important areas with low salience was longer in neurologists than in controls. Therefore it appears that neurologists intentionally scan clinically important areas when reading brain CT images showing cerebrovascular accidents. Both neurologists and control subjects used the "bottom-up salience" form of visual attention, although the neurologists more effectively used the "top-down instruction" form.},

Navigation of digitized slides is interactive and intended to simulate viewing glass slides with a microscope (virtual microscopy). Image viewing software permits users to edit, annotate, analyze, and easily share whole slide images (WSI). As a result, WSI have begun to replace the traditional light microscope, offering a myriad of opportunities for education. This article focuses on current applications of WSI in education and proficiency testing. WSI has been successfully explored for graduate education (medical, dental, and veterinary schools), training of pathology residents, as an educational tool in allied pathology schools (e.g., cytotechnology), for virtual tracking and tutoring, tele-education (tele-conferencing), e-learning, virtual workshops, at tumor boards, with interactive publications, and on examinations. WSI supports flexible and cost-effective distant learning and augments problem-oriented teaching, competency evaluation, and proficiency testing. WSI viewed on touchscreen displays and with tablet technology are especially beneficial for education. Further investigation is necessary to develop superior WSI applications that better support education and to design viewing stations with ergonomic tools that improve the WSI-human interface and navigation of virtual slides. Studies to determine the impact of training pathologists without exposure to actual glass slides are also needed.},

  abstract = {Technology for acquisition of virtual slides was developed in 1985; however, it was not until the late 1990s that desktop computers had enough processing speed to commercialize virtual microscopy and apply the technology to education. By 2000, the progressive decrease in use of traditional microscopy in medical student education had set the stage for the entry of virtual microscopy into medical schools. Since that time, it has been successfully implemented into many pathology courses in the United States and around the world, with surveys indicating that about 50\% of pathology courses already have or expect to implement virtual microscopy. Over the last decade, in addition to an increasing ability to emulate traditional microscopy, virtual microscopy has allowed educators to take advantage of the accessibility, efficiency, and pedagogic versatility of the computer and the Internet. The cost of virtual microscopy in education is now quite reasonable after taking into account replacement cost for microscopes, maintenance of glass slides, and the fact that 1-dimensional microscope space can be converted to multiuse computer laboratories or research. Although the current technology for implementation of virtual microscopy in histopathology education is very good, it could be further improved upon by better low-power screen resolution and depth of field. Nevertheless, virtual microscopy is beginning to play an increasing role in continuing education, house staff education, and evaluation of competency in histopathology. As Z-axis viewing (focusing) becomes more efficient, virtual microscopy will also become integrated into education in cytology, hematology, microbiology, and urinalysis. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Questionnaire feedback from students strongly indicated that virtual slides solved a number of problems in their learning, while providing good to excellent image quality. A deliberate policy of allocating two students per workstation promoted collaboration and helped to maintain interest in microscopic pathology. The use of a secure browser facilitated assessment using virtual slides, with no technical or security issues arising despite high peak demand.

  abstract = {Telepathology, the practice of pathology at a long distance, has advanced continuously since 1986. Today, fourth-generation telepathology systems, so-called virtual slide telepathology systems, are being used for education applications. Both conventional and innovative surgical pathology diagnostic services are being designed and implemented as well. The technology has been commercialized by more than 30 companies in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Early adopters of telepathology have been laboratories with special challenges in providing anatomic pathology services, ranging from the need to provide anatomic pathology services at great distances to the use of the technology to increase efficiency of services between hospitals less than a mile apart. As to what often happens in medicine, early adopters of new technologies are professionals who create model programs that are successful and then stimulate the creation of infrastructure (ie, reimbursement, telecommunications, information technologies, and so on) that forms the platforms for entry of later, mainstream, adopters. The trend at medical schools, in the United States, is to go entirely digital for their pathology courses, discarding their student light microscopes, and building virtual slide laboratories. This may create a generation of pathology trainees who prefer digital pathology imaging over the traditional hands-on light microscopy. The creation of standards for virtual slide telepathology is early in its development but accelerating. The field of telepathology has now reached a tipping point at which major corporations now investing in the technology will insist that standards be created for pathology digital imaging as a value added business proposition. A key to success in teleradiology, already a growth industry, has been the implementation of standards for digital radiology imaging. Telepathology is already the enabling technology for new, innovative laboratory services. Examples include STAT QA surgical pathology second opinions at a distance and a telehealth-enabled rapid breast care service. The innovative bundling of telemammography, telepathology, and teleoncology services may represent a new paradigm in breast care that helps address the serious issue of fragmentation of breast cancer care in the United States and elsewhere. Legal and regulatory issues in telepathology are being addressed and are regarded as a potential catalyst for the next wave of telepathology advances, applications, and implementations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A Perl scripted MySQL database was used to develop the test editor and test interface. Virtual slides were created with the Aperio ScanScope. The examination consisted of 20 questions using 20 virtual slides. Slides were chosen to represent general surgical pathology specimens from a variety of organ systems. The examination was administered in a secure environment and was completed in 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Examination reliability, as an indicator of the test's ability to discriminate between trainee ability levels, was excellent (r = 0.84). The linear correlation coefficient of virtual slide competency examination score versus months of surgical pathology training was 0.83 (P = .0001). The learning curve was much steeper early in training. Correlation of virtual slide competency examination performance with resident's performance on the 64 item Resident In-Service Examination surgical pathology subsection was 0.70. Correlation of virtual slide competency examination performance with global end of rotation ratings was 0.28. This pilot implementation demonstrates that it is possible to create a short, reliable performance-based assessment tool for measuring morphologic diagnostic skill using a virtual slide competency examination. Furthermore, the examination as implemented in our program will be a valid measure of an individual resident's progress in morphologic competency. Virtual slide technology and computer accessibility have advanced to the point that the virtual slide competency examination model implemented in our program could have applicability across multiple residency programs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The teaching of visual diagnostic reasoning skills, to date, has been conducted in a largely unstructured apprenticeship manner. The purpose of this study was to assess if the introduction of two educational interventions improved the visual diagnostic reasoning skills of novices. These were (1) the active use of key diagnostic features and (2) image repetition. A pre-test and post-test research design was used to compare the two teaching interventions to a traditional teaching group and an expert group using eye tracking as an assessment method. The time to diagnosis and the percentage of time spent viewing an area of diagnostic interest (AOI) were compared using independent t -tests, paired t -tests, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Diagnostic accuracy as a dichotomous variable was compared using chi-square tables. Students taught in an active-learning manner with image repetition behaved most like experts, with no significant difference from experts for percentage of time spent in the AOIs and a significantly faster time to diagnosis than experts ( p},

  abstract = {Rationale and Objectives Use data collected independently at three institutions to compare time to first fixate the true lesion in searching for cancers on mammograms. Examine the fit of the results to a holistic model of visual perception. Materials and Methods The time required to first fixate a cancer on a mammogram was extracted from 400 eye-tracking records collected independently from three institutions. The time was used as an indicator of the initial perception of cancer. The distribution of first fixation times was partitioned into two normally distributed components using mixture distribution analysis. The true-positive fraction of each component was calculated. Results About 57\% of the cancers had a 95\% chance of being fixated in the first second of viewing. The remainder took longer (range, 1.0 to 15.2 seconds). The true-positive fraction was larger for the lesions hit immediately for most of the readers (TPF = 0.63 vs. 0.52, F = 5.88, P = .02) in 68\% (13/19) of the readers. Conclusions The initial detection occurs before visual scanning and, therefore, must be the result of a parallel ``global'' analysis of the image resulting in an initial holistic, gestalt-like perception. The development of expertise in medical image analysis may consist of a shift in the recognition mechanism from scan-look-detect to look-detect-scan.},

  abstract = {Embryo selection in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment has traditionally been done manually using microscopy at intermittent time points during embryo development. Novel technique has made it possible to monitor embryos using time lapse for long periods of time and together with the reduced cost of data storage, this has opened the door to long-term time-lapse monitoring, and large amounts of image material is now routinely gathered. However, the analysis is still to a large extent performed manually, and images are mostly used as qualitative reference. To make full use of the increased amount of microscopic image material, (semi)automated computer-aided tools are needed. An additional benefit of automation is the establishment of standardization tools for embryo selection and transfer, making decisions more transparent and less subjective. Another is the possibility to gather and analyze data in a high-throughput manner, gathering data from multiple clinics and increasing our knowledge of early human embryo development. In this study, the extraction of data to automatically select and track spatio-temporal events and features from sets of embryo images has been achieved using localized variance based on the distribution of image grey scale levels. A retrospective cohort study was performed using time-lapse imaging data derived from 39 human embryos from seven couples, covering the time from fertilization up to 6.3 days. The profile of localized variance has been used to characterize syngamy, mitotic division and stages of cleavage, compaction, and blastocoel formation. Prior to analysis, focal plane and embryo location were automatically detected, limiting precomputational user interaction to a calibration step and usable for automatic detection of region of interest (ROI) regardless of the method of analysis. The results were validated against the opinion of clinical experts. (c) 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To describe the theory and develop an automated virtual slide screening system. Theoretical considerations. Tissue-based diagnosis separates into (a) sampling procedure to allocate the slide area containing diagnostic information, and (b) evaluation of diagnosis from the selected area. Nyquist's theorem broadly applied in acoustics, serves to presetting the sampling accuracy. Tissue-based diagnosis relies on two different information systems: (a) texture, and (b) object information. Texture information can be derived by recursive formulas without image segmentation. Object information requires image segmentation and feature extraction. Both algorithms complete another to a "self-learning" classification system. METHODS: Non-overlapping compartments of the original virtual slide (image) are chosen at random with predefined error-rate (Nyquist's theorem). The standardized image compartments are subject for texture and object analysis. The recursive formula of texture analysis computes median gray values and local noise distribution. Object analysis includes automated measurements of immunohistochemically stained slides. The computations performed at different magnifications (x 2, x 4.5, x 10, x 20, x 40) are subject to multivariate statistically analysis and diagnosis classification. RESULTS: A total of 808 lung cancer cases of diagnoses groups: cohort (1) normal lung (318 cases) - cancer (490 cases); cancer subdivided: cohort (2) small cell lung cancer (10 cases) - non-small cell lung cancer (480 cases); non-small cell lung cancer subdivided: cohort (3) squamous cell carcinoma (318 cases) - adenocarcinoma (194 cases) - large cell carcinoma (70 cases) was analyzed. Cohorts (1) and (2) were classified correctly in 100\%, cohort (3) in more than 95\%. The selected area can be limited to 10\% of the original image without increased error rate. A second approach included 233 breast tissue cases (105 normal, 128 breast carcinomas) and 88 lung tissue cases (58 normal, 38 cancer). Texture analysis revealed a correct classification with only 10 training set cases in {$>$}92\% for both, breast and lung tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The developed system is a fast and reliable procedure to fulfill all requirements for an automated "pre-screening" of virtual slides in tissue-based diagnosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Virtual Microscopy based on completely digitalised histological slide. Concerning this digitalisation many new features in mircoscopy can be processed by the computer. New applications are possible or old, well known techniques of image analyses can be adapted for routine use. AIMS: A so called diagnostic path observes in the way of a professional sees through a histological virtual slide combined with the text information of the dictation process. This feature can be used for image retrieval, quality assurance or for educational purpose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The diagnostic path implements a metadata structure of image information. It stores and processes the different images seen by a pathologist during his "slide viewing" and the obtained image sequence ("observation path"). Contemporary, the structural details of the pathology reports were analysed. The results were transferred into an XML structure. Based on this structure, a report editor and a search function were implemented. The report editor compiles the "diagnostic path", which is the connection from the image viewing sequence ("observation path") and the oral report sequence of the findings ("dictation path"). The time set ups of speech and image viewing serve for the link between the two sequences. The search tool uses the obtained diagnostic path. It allows the user to search for particular histological hallmarks in pathology reports and in the corresponding images. RESULTS: The new algorithm was tested on 50 pathology reports and 74 attached histological images. The creation of a new individual diagnostic path is automatically performed during the routine diagnostic process. The test prototype experienced an insignificant prolongation of the diagnosis procedure (oral case description and stated diagnosis by the pathologist) and a fast and reliable retrieval, especially useful for continuous education and quality control of case description and diagnostic work. DISCUSSION: The Digital Virtual Microscope has been designed to handle 1000 images per day in the daily routine work of a pathology institution. It implies the necessity of an automatic mechanism of image meta dating. The non - deterministic correlation between the oral statements (case report) and image information content guides the image meta dating. The presented software opens up new possibilities for a content oriented search in a virtual slide, and can successfully support medical education and diagnostic quality assurance.},

Design: Standard methods of information-processing and cognitive science were used to study diagnostic processes (search, perception, reasoning) of 28 novices, intermediates, and experts. Participants examined cases in breast pathology; each case had a previously established gold standard diagnosis. Videotapes correlated the actual visual data examined by participants with their verbal "think-aloud" protocols. Measurements: Investigators measured accuracy, difficulty, certainty, protocol process frequencies, error frequencies, and times to key diagnostic events for each case and subject. Analyses of variance, chi-square tests and post-hoc comparisons were performed with subject as the unit of analysis. Results: Level of expertise corresponded with differences in search, perception, and reasoning components of the tasks. Several discrete steps occur on the path to competence, including development of adequate search strategies, rapid and accurate recognition of anatomic location, acquisition of visual data interpretation skills, and transitory reliance on explicit feature identification. Conclusion: Results provide the basis for an empirical cognitive model of competence for the complex tasks of microscopic pathology diagnosis. Results will inform the development of computer-based pedagogy tools in this domain.},

  abstract = {The nucleus of an eukaryotic cell is a membrane-bound organelle containing a major part of the cellular genome. Nuclear shape is controlled by forces generated in the cyto- skeleton, nuclear envelope and matrix of the nucleus and may change when the balance of these forces is disturbed. In certain cases, such changes may be indicative of cell pathology. Nuclear shape feature is being commonly addressed in both experimental research and diagnostics; nevertheless its symmetry-related aspects receive little attention. This article introduces a technique allowing to estimate nuclear shape asymmetry in digi- tal images captured from cyto- or histological preparations. Implemented in a software package, this technique quantifies the asymmetry using two scenarios. The first one pre- sumes the identification of nuclear pixels laying outside the largest inscribed circle. According to the second scenario, the algorithm searches for nuclear pixels lacking pixel- partners symmetric with respect to the nuclear area's centroid. In both cases, the propor- tion of ``asymmetric'' pixels is used to estimate the feature of interest. The technique was validated on images of cell nuclei having distinctive shape phenotypes. A conclusion was made that shape asymmetry feature may be useful accessory to the toolbox of nuclear morphometry. V},

  abstract = {Machine learning techniques have been widely used to detect morphological abnormalities from structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data and to support the diagnosis of neurological diseases such as dementia. In this paper, we propose to use a multiple instance learning (MIL) method in an application for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In our work, local intensity patches are extracted as features. However, not all the patches extracted from patients with dementia are equally affected by the disease and some of them may not be characteristic of morphology associated with the disease. Therefore, there is some ambiguity in assigning disease labels to these patches. The problem of the ambiguous training labels can be addressed by weakly supervised learning techniques such as MIL. A graph is built for each image to exploit the relationships among the patches and then to solve the MIL problem. The constructed graphs contain information about the appearances of patches and the relationships among them, which can reflect the inherent structures of images and aids the classification. Using the baseline MR images of 834 subjects from the ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 89\% between AD patients and healthy controls, and 70\% between patients defined as stable MCI and progressive MCI in a leave-one-out cross validation. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods using the same dataset, the proposed method can achieve similar or improved results, providing an alternative framework for the detection and prediction of neurodegenerative diseases. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The categorization of intraductal proliferative lesions of the breast based on routine light microscopic examination of histopathologic sections is in many cases challenging, even for experienced pathologists. The development of computational tools to aid pathologists in the characterization of these lesions would have great diagnostic and clinical value. As a first step to address this issue, we evaluated the ability of computational image analysis to accurately classify DCIS and UDH and to stratify nuclear grade within DCIS. Using 116 breast biopsies diagnosed as DCIS or UDH from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), we developed a computational method to extract 392 features corresponding to the mean and standard deviation in nuclear size and shape, intensity, and texture across 8 color channels. We used L1-regularized logistic regression to build classification models to discriminate DCIS from UDH. The top-performing model contained 22 active features and achieved an AUC of 0.95 in cross-validation on the MGH data-set. We applied this model to an external validation set of 51 breast biopsies diagnosed as DCIS or UDH from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the model achieved an AUC of 0.86. The top-performing model contained active features from all color-spaces and from the three classes of features (morphology, intensity, and texture), suggesting the value of each for prediction. We built models to stratify grade within DCIS and obtained strong performance for stratifying low nuclear grade vs. high nuclear grade DCIS (AUC = 0.98 in cross-validation) with only moderate performance for discriminating low nuclear grade vs. intermediate nuclear grade and intermediate nuclear grade vs. high nuclear grade DCIS (AUC = 0.83 and 0.69, respectively). These data show that computational pathology models can robustly discriminate benign from malignant intraductal proliferative lesions of the breast and may aid pathologists in the diagnosis and classification of these lesions.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0112447},
  abstract = {Background Clinical diagnosis of actinic keratosis is known to have intra- and inter-observer variability, and there is currently no non-invasive and objective measure to diagnose these lesions. Objective The aim of this pilot study was to determine if automatically detecting and circumscribing actinic keratoses in clinical photographs is feasible. Methods Photographs of the face and dorsal forearms were acquired in 20 volunteers from two groups: the first with at least on actinic keratosis present on the face and each arm, the second with no actinic keratoses. The photographs were automatically analysed using colour space transforms and morphological features to detect erythema. The automated output was compared with a senior consultant dermatologist's assessment of the photographs, including the intra-observer variability. Performance was assessed by the correlation between total lesions detected by automated method and dermatologist, and whether the individual lesions detected were in the same location as the dermatologist identified lesions. Additionally, the ability to limit false positives was assessed by automatic assessment of the photographs from the no actinic keratosis group in comparison to the high actinic keratosis group. Results The correlation between the automatic and dermatologist counts was 0.62 on the face and 0.51 on the arms, compared to the dermatologist's intra-observer variation of 0.83 and 0.93 for the same. Sensitivity of automatic detection was 39.5\% on the face, 53.1\% on the arms. Positive predictive values were 13.9\% on the face and 39.8\% on the arms. Significantly more lesions (p\{\textbackslash{}textless\}0.0001) were detected in the high actinic keratosis group compared to the no actinic keratosis group. Conclusions The proposed method was inferior to assessment by the dermatologist in terms of sensitivity and positive predictive value. However, this pilot study used only a single simple feature and was still able to achieve sensitivity of detection of 53.1\% on the arms.This suggests that image analysis is a feasible avenue of investigation for overcoming variability in clinical assessment. Future studies should focus on more sophisticated features to improve sensitivity for actinic keratoses without erythema and limit false positives associated with the anatomical structures on the face.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large quantities of digital images are now generated for biological collections, including those developed in projects premised on the high-throughput screening of genome-phenome experiments. These images often carry annotations on taxonomy and observable features, such as anatomical structures and phenotype variations often recorded in response to the environmental factors under which the organisms were sampled. At present, most of these annotations are described in free text, may involve limited use of non-standard vocabularies, and rarely specify precise coordinates of features on the image plane such that a computer vision algorithm could identify, extract and annotate them. Therefore, researchers and curators need a tool that can identify and demarcate features in an image plane and allow their annotation with semantically contextual ontology terms. Such a tool would generate data useful for inter and intra-specific comparison and encourage the integration of curation standards. In the future, quality annotated image segments may provide training data sets for developing machine learning applications for automated image annotation.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: We developed a novel image segmentation and annotation software application, "Annotation of Image Segments with Ontologies" (AISO). The tool enables researchers and curators to delineate portions of an image into multiple highlighted segments and annotate them with an ontology-based controlled vocabulary.

  abstract = {Optical examination of microscale features in pathology slides is one of the gold standards to diagnose disease. However, the use of conventional light microscopes is partially limited owing to their relatively high cost, bulkiness of lens-based optics, small field of view (FOV), and requirements for lateral scanning and three-dimensional (3D) focus adjustment. We illustrate the performance of a computational lens-free, holographic on-chip microscope that uses the transport-of-intensity equation, multi-height iterative phase retrieval, and rotational field transformations to perform wide-FOV imaging of pathology samples with comparable image quality to a traditional transmission lens- based microscope. The holographically reconstructed image can be digitally focused at any depth within the object FOV (after image capture) without the need for mechanical focus adjustment and is also digitally corrected for arti- facts arising fromuncontrolled tilting and height variations between the sample and sensor planes. Using this lens-free on-chip microscope, we successfully imaged invasive carcinoma cells within human breast sections, Papanicolaou smears revealing a high-grade squamous intraepitheliallesion, and sickle cellanemia blood smears over a FOV of 20.5 mm2.The resulting wide-field lens-free images had sufficient image resolution and contrast for clinical evalua- tion, as demonstrated by a pathologist'sblinded diagnosisof breast cancer tissue samples, achieving an overall accuracy of \textasciitilde{}99\%. By providing high-resolution images oflarge-area pathology samples with 3Ddigital focus ad- justment, lens-free on-chip microscopy can be useful in resource-limited and point-of-care settings.},

  doi = {10.4103/2153-3539.112693},
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In the framework of the Cognitive Microscope (MICO) project, we have set up a contest about mitosis detection in images of H and E stained slides of breast cancer for the conference ICPR 2012. Mitotic count is an important parameter for the prognosis of breast cancer. However, mitosis detection in digital histopathology is a challenging problem that needs a deeper study. Indeed, mitosis detection is difficult because mitosis are small objects with a large variety of shapes, and they can thus be easily confused with some other objects or artefacts present in the image. We added a further dimension to the contest by using two different slide scanners having different resolutions and producing red-green-blue (RGB) images, and a multi-spectral microscope producing images in 10 different spectral bands and 17 layers Z-stack. 17 teams participated in the study and the best team achieved a recall rate of 0.7 and precision of 0.89. CONTEXT: Several studies on automatic tools to process digitized slides have been reported focusing mainly on nuclei or tubule detection. Mitosis detection is a challenging problem that has not yet been addressed well in the literature. AIMS: Mitotic count is an important parameter in breast cancer grading as it gives an evaluation of the aggressiveness of the tumor. However, consistency, reproducibility and agreement on mitotic count for the same slide can vary largely among pathologists. An automatic tool for this task may help for reaching a better consistency, and at the same time reducing the burden of this demanding task for the pathologists. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Professor Fr{$\iota$}d{$\iota$}rique Capron team of the pathology department at Piti{$\iota$}-Salp{$\kappa$}tri\texttheta{}re Hospital in Paris, France, has selected a set of five slides of breast cancer. The slides are stained with H and E. They have been scanned by three different equipments: Aperio ScanScope XT slide scanner, Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0-HT slide scanner and 10 bands multispectral microscope. The data set is made up of 50 high power fields (HPF) coming from 5 different slides scanned at \texttimes{}40 magnification. There are 10 HPFs/slide. The pathologist has annotated all the mitotic cells manually. A HPF has a size of 512 {$\mu$}m \texttimes{} 512 {$\mu$}m (that is an area of 0.262 mm (2) , which is a surface equivalent to that of a microscope field diameter of 0.58 mm. These 50 HPFs contain a total of 326 mitotic cells on images of both scanners, and 322 mitotic cells on the multispectral microscope. RESULTS: Up to 129 teams have registered to the contest. However, only 17 teams submitted their detection of mitotic cells. The performance of the best team is very promising, with F-measure as high as 0.78. However, the database we provided is by far too small for a good assessment of reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Mitotic count is an important criterion in the grading of many types of cancers, however, very little research has been made on automatic mitotic cell detection, mainly because of a lack of available data. A main objective of this contest was to propose a database of mitotic cells on digitized breast cancer histopathology slides to initiate works on automated mitotic cell detection. In the future, we would like to extend this database to have much more images from different patients and also for different types of cancers. In addition, mitotic cells should be annotated by several pathologists to reflect the partial agreement among them.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: There is increasing interest in using whole slide imaging (WSI) for diagnostic purposes (primary and/or consultation). An important consideration is whether WSI can safely replace conventional light microscopy as the method by which pathologists review histologic sections, cytology slides, and/or hematology slides to render diagnoses. Validation of WSI is crucial to ensure that diagnostic performance based on digitized slides is at least equivalent to that of glass slides and light microscopy. Currently, there are no standard guidelines regarding validation of WSI for diagnostic use.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nOBJECTIVE: To recommend validation requirements for WSI systems to be used for diagnostic purposes.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nDESIGN: The College of American Pathologists Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center convened a nonvendor panel from North America with expertise in digital pathology to develop these validation recommendations. A literature review was performed in which 767 international publications that met search term requirements were identified. Studies outside the scope of this effort and those related solely to technical elements, education, and image analysis were excluded. A total of 27 publications were graded and underwent data extraction for evidence evaluation. Recommendations were derived from the strength of evidence determined from 23 of these published studies, open comment feedback, and expert panel consensus.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: Twelve guideline statements were established to help pathology laboratories validate their own WSI systems intended for clinical use. Validation of the entire WSI system, involving pathologists trained to use the system, should be performed in a manner that emulates the laboratory's actual clinical environment. It is recommended that such a validation study include at least 60 routine cases per application, comparing intraobserver diagnostic concordance between digitized and glass slides viewed at least 2 weeks apart. It is important that the validation process confirm that all material present on a glass slide to be scanned is included in the digital image.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Validation should demonstrate that the WSI system under review produces acceptable digital slides for diagnostic interpretation. The intention of validating WSI systems is to permit the clinical use of this technology in a manner that does not compromise patient care.},

  abstract = {The computing time for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms can be prohibitively large for datasets with many observations, especially when the data density for each observation is costly to evaluate. We propose a framework where the likelihood function is estimated from a random subset of the data, resulting in substantially fewer density evaluations. The data subsets are selected using an efficient Probability Proportional-to-Size (PPS) sampling scheme, where the inclusion probability of an observation is proportional to an approximation of its contribution to the log-likelihood function. Three broad classes of approximations are presented. The proposed algorithm is shown to sample from a distribution that is within O(m-\textonehalf{}) of the true posterior, where m is the subsample size. Moreover, the constant in the O(m-\textonehalf{}) error bound of the likelihood is shown to be small and the approximation error is demonstrated to be negligible even for a small m in our applications.We propose a simple way to adaptively choose the sample size m during the MCMC to optimize sampling efficiency for a fixed computational budget. The method is applied to a bivariate probit model on a data set with half a million observations, and on a Weibull regression model with random effects for discrete-time survival data.},

  abstract = {A standard mode of inference in social and behavioral science is to establish stylized facts using statistical significance in quantitative studies. However, in a world in which measurements are noisy and effects are small, this will not work: selection on statistical significance leads to effect sizes which are overestimated and often in the wrong direction. After a brief discussion of two examples, one in economics and one in social psychology, we consider the procedural solution of open post-publication review, the design solution of devoting more effort to accurate measurements and within-person comparisons, and the statistical analysis solution of multilevel modeling and reporting all results rather than selection on significance. We argue that the current replication crisis in science arises in part from the ill effects of null hypothesis significance testing being used to study small effects with noisy data. In such settings, apparent success comes easy but truly replicable results require a more serious connection between theory, measurement, and data.},

However, these experiments are prone to high levels of unexplained technical noise, creating new challenges for identifying genes that show genuine heterogeneous expression within the population of cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model where: (i) cell-specific normalisation constants are estimated as part of the model parameters, (ii) technical variability is quantified based on spike-in genes that are artificially introduced to each analysed cell's lysate and (iii) the total variability of the expression counts is decomposed into technical and biological components. BASiCS also provides an intuitive detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable genes within the population of cells under study. This is formalised by means of tail posterior probabilities associated to high (or low) biological cell-to-cell variance contributions, quantities that can be easily interpreted by users. We demonstrate our method using gene expression measurements from mouse Embryonic Stem Cells. Cross-validation and meaningful enrichment of gene ontology categories within genes classified as highly (or lowly) variable supports the efficacy of our approach.},

We explored how aging affects transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated na\"ive and effector memory CD4+ T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species. In young animals, immunological activation drives a conserved transcriptomic switch, resulting in tightly controlled gene expression characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging perturbed the activation of this core program and increased expression heterogeneity across populations of cells in both species.

  abstract = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

  abstract = {The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations. Here we show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.},

Normal brain function relies on a diverse set of differentiated cell types, including neurons, glia, and vasculature. Here, we have used large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to classify cells in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampal CA1 region. We found 47 molecularly distinct subclasses, comprising all known major cell types in the cortex. We identified numerous marker genes, which allowed alignment with known cell types, morphology, and location. We found a layer I interneuron expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by Itpr2. Across the diversity of cortical cell types, transcription factors formed a complex, layered regulatory code, suggesting a mechanism for the maintenance of adult cell type identity.},

  abstract = {Understanding the development and function of an organ requires the characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating subpopulations of cells are based on messenger RNA or protein expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells, is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected cells from mouse intestinal organoids, cultured self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at widely different abundances. Since available computational methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type identification in complex populations of single cells. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of hormone-producing intestinal cells. Next, we use Reg4 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells. We envision broad applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased organs.},

The epiblast subsequently undergoes considerable expansion of cell numbers prior to gastrulation. To investigate underlying regulatory principles, we performed systematic single-cell RNA sequencing (seq) of conceptuses from E3.5 to E6.5. The epiblast shows reactivation and subsequent inactivation of the X chromosome, with Zfp57 expression associated with reactivation and inactivation together with other candidate regulators. At E6.5, the transition from epiblast to primitive streak is linked with decreased expression of polycomb subunits, suggesting a key regulatory role. Notably, our analyses suggest elevated transcriptional noise at E3.5 and within the non-committed epiblast at E6.5, coinciding with exit from pluripotency. By contrast, E6.5 primitive streak cells became highly synchronized and exhibit a shortened G1 cell-cycle phase, consistent with accelerated proliferation. Our study systematically charts transcriptional noise and uncovers molecular processes associated with early lineage decisions.},

  abstract = {Mammalian pre-implantation development is a complex process involving dramatic changes in the transcriptional architecture. We report here a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome dynamics from oocyte to morula in both human and mouse embryos, using single-cell RNA sequencing. Based on single-nucleotide variants in human blastomere messenger RNAs and paternal-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify novel stage-specific monoallelic expression patterns for a significant portion of polymorphic gene transcripts (25 to 53\%). By weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we find that each developmental stage can be delineated concisely by a small number of functional modules of co-expressed genes. This result indicates a sequential order of transcriptional changes in pathways of cell cycle, gene regulation, translation and metabolism, acting in a step-wise fashion from cleavage to morula. Cross-species comparisons with mouse pre-implantation embryos reveal that the majority of human stage-specific modules (7 out of 9) are notably preserved, but developmental specificity and timing differ between human and mouse. Furthermore, we identify conserved key members (or hub genes) of the human and mouse networks. These genes represent novel candidates that are likely to be key in driving mammalian pre-implantation development. Together, the results provide a valuable resource to dissect gene regulatory mechanisms underlying progressive development of early mammalian embryos.},

Here, to investigate the nature and extent of intra-tumour diversification, we characterized organoids derived from multiple single cells from three colorectal cancers as well as from adjacent normal intestinal crypts. Colorectal cancer cells showed extensive mutational diversification and carried several times more somatic mutations than normal colorectal cells. Most mutations were acquired during the final dominant clonal expansion of the cancer and resulted from mutational processes that are absent from normal colorectal cells. Intra-tumour diversification of DNA methylation and transcriptome states also occurred; these alterations were cell-autonomous, stable, and followed the phylogenetic tree of each cancer. There were marked differences in responses to anticancer drugs between even closely related cells of the same tumour. The results indicate that colorectal cancer cells experience substantial increases in somatic mutation rate compared to normal colorectal cells, and that genetic diversification of each cancer is accompanied by pervasive, stable and inherited differences in the biological states of individual cancer cells.},

This adaptive sub-sampling technique is an alternative to the re-cent approach developed in (Korattikara et al., 2014), and it allows us to establish rigorously that the resulting approximate MH algorithm samples from a perturbed version of the target distribu-tion of interest, whose total variation distance to this very target is controlled explicitly.

FlyMC is compatible with a wide variety of modern MCMC algorithms, and only requires a lower bound on the per-datum likelihood factors. In experiments, we find that FlyMC generates samples from the posterior more than an order of magnitude faster than regular MCMC, opening up MCMC methods to larger datasets than were previously considered feasible.},

We discuss the consequences of our results on the applicability of pseudo-marginal algorithms and thus on the possibility of exact inference in intractable models.

  abstract = {Practitioners of Bayesian statistics have long depended on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain samples from intractable posterior distributions. Unfortunately, MCMC algorithms are typically serial, and do not scale to the large datasets typical of modern machine learning. The recently proposed consensus Monte Carlo algorithm removes this limitation by partitioning the data and drawing samples conditional on each partition in parallel (Scott et al, 2013). A fixed aggregation function then combines these samples, yielding approximate posterior samples. We introduce variational consensus Monte Carlo (VCMC), a variational Bayes algorithm that optimizes over aggregation functions to obtain samples from a distribution that better approximates the target. The resulting objective contains an intractable entropy term; we therefore derive a relaxation of the objective and show that the relaxed problem is blockwise concave under mild conditions. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm on three inference tasks from the literature, demonstrating both the superior quality of the posterior approximation and the moderate overhead of the optimization step. Our algorithm achieves a relative error reduction (measured against serial MCMC) of up to 39\% compared to consensus Monte Carlo on the task of estimating 300-dimensional probit regression parameter expectations; similarly, it achieves an error reduction of 92\% on the task of estimating cluster comembership probabilities in a Gaussian mixture model with 8 components in 8 dimensions. Furthermore, these gains come at moderate cost compared to the runtime of serial MCMC, achieving near-ideal speedup in some instances.},

Divide-and-conquer strategies, which split the data into batches and, for each batch, run independent MCMC algorithms targeting the corresponding subposterior, can spread the computational burden across a number of separate workers. The challenge with such strategies is in recombining the subposteriors to approximate the full posterior. By creating a Gaussian-process approximation for each log-subposterior density we create a tractable approximation for the full posterior. This approximation is exploited through three methodologies: firstly a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm targeting the expectation of the posterior density provides a sample from an approximation to the posterior; secondly, evaluating the true posterior at the sampled points leads to an importance sampler that, asymptotically, targets the true posterior expectations; finally, an alternative importance sampler uses the full Gaussian-process distribution of the approximation to the log-posterior density to re-weight any initial sample and provide both an estimate of the posterior expectation and a measure of the uncertainty in it.},

This research identifies areas and patterns of visual fixation when observing dental periapical radiographs. Methods: In an observational study using eye tracking technology and a convenience sample of 44 observers, the interpretations of 4 dental periapical radiographs were recorded using Camtasia Software (TechSmith, Okemos, MI) with a gaze tracking ``bubble'' denoting where within the radiograph the observers' eyes gazed. The recorded observations included the scanning pattern, the area of first fixation, and revisits of areas. Also noted was whether the area of first fixation or revisit was radiopaque, radiolucent, or of normal radiodensity and whether it was a coronal or radicular area. Results: The first fixation is more likely to be an area of high contrast that is either radiopaque or radiolucent compared with areas that were normal or of average gray scale. Significantly more revisits occurred on areas that were radiopaque and located in the radicular area. Of the 4 categorized scanning patterns, tooth by tooth scanning predominated. Conclusions: When interpreting dental periapical radiographs, significantly more observers initially fixated on areas of the radiograph that were of high contrast (ie, radiopaque or radiolucent) compared with ``normal areas.'' A tooth by tooth scanning pattern was most commonly used.},

We investigated gaze points of CT colonography (CTC) interpretation process, and analyzed the difference in gaze points between experts and trainees. In this study, we attempted to understand how trainees can be improved to a level achieved by experts in viewing of CTC. We used an eye gaze point sensing system, Gazefineder (JVCKENWOOD Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), which can detect pupil point and corneal reflection point by the dark pupil eye tracking. This system can provide gaze points images and excel file data. The subjects are radiological technologists who are experienced, and inexperienced in reading CTC. We performed observer studies in reading virtual pathology images and examined observer's image interpretation process using gaze points data. Furthermore, we examined eye tracking frequency analysis by using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We were able to understand the difference in gaze points between experts and trainees by use of the frequency analysis. The result of the trainee had a large amount of both high-frequency components and low-frequency components. In contrast, both components by the expert were relatively low. Regarding the amount of eye movement in every 0.02 second we found that the expert tended to interpret images slowly and calmly. On the other hand, the trainee was moving eyes quickly and also looking for wide areas. We can assess the difference in the gaze points on CTC between experts and trainees by use of the eye gaze point sensing system and based on the frequency analysis. The potential improvements in CTC interpretation for trainees can be evaluated by using gaze points data.},

The DBT modality has been integrated into a regional breast screening program in Italy for several years. The purpose of this study is to examine the experienced Italian DBT readers' visual search behaviour and summarise their visual inspection patterns. Seven experienced radiologists took part in the study, reading a set of DBT cases with a mixture of both normal and abnormal cases whilst their eye movements data were recorded. They read the cases through a fixed procedure starting with a 2D overview and then went through the DBT view of each side of the breasts. It was found that the experienced readers tended to perform a global-focal scan over the 2D view to detect the abnormality and then `drilled' through the DBT slices, interpreting the details of the feature. The reading speed was also investigated to see if there was any difference in length of time when expert radiologists examine both normal and abnormal cases. The results showed that there was no significant difference in time between normal and abnormal cases. The eye movement patterns revealed that experienced DBT readers covered more areas on the 2D view and fixated longer and with more dwells inside the AOI in the 3D view. Based on these findings it is hoped that by understanding the visual search patterns of the experienced DBT radiologists, it could potentially help DBT trainees to develop more efficient interpretation approaches.},

Recently, healthcare researchers have started to show interest in using eye-tracking techniques to study medical decision-making. Mapping the literature pertaining to eye tracking using a systematic approach is valuable at this point to bring together all the studies to date on how medical decision-makers make decisions, and the results may contribute to clinical training. This review follows Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework to improve our understanding of visual cue processing in medical decision-making. A diverse range of studies was identified, and the results are presented descriptively to develop a more coherent understanding of different aspects of cue processing and errors in medical decision-making. The review shows the need for more extensive investigations of cue processing and medical decision-making.},

  doi = {10.4103/2153-3539.168517},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying new and more robust assessments of proficiency/expertise  (finding new "biomarkers of expertise") in histopathology is desirable for many reasons. Advances in digital pathology permit new and innovative tests such as flash viewing tests and eye tracking and slide navigation analyses that would not be possible with a traditional microscope. The main purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness of time-restricted testing of expertise in histopathology using digital images. METHODS: 19 novices (undergraduate medical students), 18 intermediates (trainees), and 19 experts (consultants) were invited to give their opinion on 20 general histopathology cases after 1 s and 10 s viewing times. Differences in performance between groups were measured and the internal reliability of the test was calculated. RESULTS: There were highly significant differences in performance between the groups using the Fisher's least significant difference method for multiple comparisons. Differences between groups were consistently greater in the 10-s than the 1-s test. The Kuder-Richardson 20 internal reliability coefficients were very high for both tests: 0.905 for the 1-s test and 0.926 for the 10-s test. Consultants had levels of diagnostic accuracy of 72\% at 1 s and 83\% at 10 s. CONCLUSIONS: Time-restricted tests using digital images have the potential to be extremely reliable tests of diagnostic proficiency in histopathology. A 10-s viewing test may be more reliable than a 1-s test. Over-reliance on "at a glance" diagnoses in histopathology is a potential source of medical error due to over-confidence bias and premature closure.},

In this study we have replicated an earlier study by Romero et al.

The study involved ten subjects debugging short Java programs using the \{SDE.\} The \{SDE\} included three different representations of the Java programs, those of the program source code, a visualization of the program, and its output concurrently in three separate panels in \{SDE.\} We used the Restricted Focus Viewer (\{RFV)\} and a remote eye tracker to collect the visual attention of the subjects. A with-in subject design, similar to Romero et al., employing both \{RFV/no-RVF\} task conditions was used. The overall results of the time distributions over three different representations of the programs agree with the study of Romero et al. But the results of visual attention switching raise some questions to be considered in later studies.},

  doi = {10.1186/1471-2458-12-352},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: While the majority of the health messages on cigarette packages contain threatening health information, previous studies indicate that risk information can trigger defensive reactions, especially when the information is self-relevant (i.e., smokers). Providing coping information, information that provides help for quitting smoking, might increase attention to health messages instead of triggering defensive reactions. METHODS: Eye-movement registration can detect attention preferences for different health education messages over a longer period of time during message exposure. In a randomized, experimental study with 23 smoking and 41 non-smoking student volunteers, eye-movements were recorded for sixteen self-created cigarette packages containing health texts that presented either high risk or coping information combined with a high threat or a low threat smoking-related photo. RESULTS: Results of the eye movement data showed that smokers tend to spend more time looking (i.e., more unique fixations and longer dwell time) at the coping information than at the high risk information irrespective of the content of the smoking-related photo. Non-smokers tend to spend more time looking at the high risk information than at the coping information when the information was presented in combination with a high threat smoking photo. When a low threat photo was presented, non-smokers paid more attention to the coping information than to the high risk information. Results for the smoking photos showed more attention allocation for low threat photos that were presented in combination with high risk information than for low threat photos in combination with coping information . No attention differences were found for the high threat photos. CONCLUSIONS: Non-smokers demonstrated an attention preference for high risk information as opposed to coping information, but only when text information was presented in combination with a high threat photo. For smokers, however, our findings suggest more attention allocation for coping information than for health risk information. This preference for coping information is not reflected in current health messages to motivate smokers to quit smoking. Coping information should be more frequently implemented in health message design to increase attention for these messages and thus contribute to effective persuasion.},

Pupil detection algorithms are generally implemented in hardware, allowing for real-time eyetracking. However, it is likely that real-time eyetracking will soon be fully accomplished in software alone. This paper encourages an ``open-source'' approach to eyetracking by providing practical tips on building a lightweight eyetracker from commercially available micro-lens cameras and other parts. While the headgear described here can be used with any dark-pupil eyetracking controller, it also opens the door to open-source software solutions that could be developed by the eyetracking and image-processing communities. Such systems could be optimized without concern for real-time performance because the systems could be run offline.},

Despite its potential public health role, there have been few published studies on the effectiveness of these warnings as a health message. The present study used well-accepted market research methods to examine adolescent viewing of tobacco advertisements. Sixty-one adolescents participated in the study. Eye tracking was used to study how participants viewed five different tobacco advertisements. The average viewing time of the warning amounted to only 8\% of the total advertisement viewing time. In 43.6\% of cases, the warning was not viewed at all. Following the advertisement viewing, participants were asked to identify the observed warnings within a list that included other simulated warnings. Subjects did only slightly better than random guessing in this test of recognition. Using market research criteria, the federally mandated warning must be viewed as an ineffective public health message in so far as adolescents are concerned.(JAMA 1989;261:84-89)},

Over the last two decades, the number of web-based pathology resources has expanded dramatically with centralized pathological resources being delivered to many students simultaneously. Recently, whole slide imaging technology allows glass slides to be scanned and viewed on a computer screen via dedicated software. This technology is referred to as virtual microscopy and has created enormous opportunities in pathological training and education. Students are able to learn key histopathological skills, e.g. to identify areas of diagnostic relevance from an entire slide, via a web-based computer environment. Students no longer need to be in the same room as the slides. New human-computer interfaces are also being developed using more natural touch technology to enhance the manipulation of digitized slides. Several major initiatives are also underway introducing online competency and diagnostic decision analysis using virtual microscopy and have important future roles in accreditation and recertification. Finally, researchers are investigating how pathological decision-making is achieved using virtual microscopy and modern eye-tracking devices. Virtual microscopy and digital pathology will continue to improve how pathology training and education is delivered.},

It is well known that radiologists' performance is not perfect: they make both false positive and false negative decisions, both of which can impact on patient care and treatment. Some of these errors can be attributed to technical difficulties such as underexposing a plain film X-ray image. Such technical explanations cannot, however, account for all the errors that are made; missed lesions are often found in retrospect. These errors can be attributed to perceptual and/or cognitive factors. The study of why these perceptual and cognitive errors occur and what steps can be taken to ameliorate them is a relatively small but growing area in the field of medical imaging. Understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to medical imaging is becoming even more important as we make the transition from the traditional film-based display to soft-copy monitor viewing of medical images. If we understand what the human visual system is capable of, we can tailor the display of medical information to take advantage of these perceptual capacities.},

These exciting opportunities also present formidable challenges to the implementation and integration of technologies in the workplace. As in most domains, there is a gulf between technologic artifacts and end users. Since medical practice is a human endeavor, there is a need for bridging disciplines to enable clinicians to benefit from rapid technologic advances. This in turn necessitates a broadening of disciplinary boundaries to consider cognitive and social factors pertaining to the design and use of technology. The authors argue for a place of prominence for cognitive science. Cognitive science provides a framework for the analysis and modeling of complex human performance and has considerable applicability to a range of issues in informatics. Its methods have been employed to illuminate different facets of design and implementation. This approach has also yielded insights into the mechanisms and processes involved in collaborative design. Cognitive scientific methods and theories are illustrated in the context of two examples that examine human-computer interaction in medical contexts and computer-mediated collaborative processes. The framework outlined in this paper can be used to refine the process of iterative design, end-user training, and productive practice.},

However, cursor interactions are not all the same; different types of cursor behavior patterns exist, such as reading, hesitating, scrolling and clicking, each of which has a different meaning. We conduct a search study with 36 subjects and 32 search tasks to determine when gaze and cursor are aligned, and thus when the cursor position is a good proxy for gaze position. We study the effect of time, behavior patterns, user, and search task on the gaze-cursor alignment, findings which lead us to question the maxim that ``gaze is well approximated by cursor.'' These lessons inform an experiment in which we predict the gaze position with better accuracy than simply using the cursor position, improving the state-of-the-art technique for approximating visual attention with the cursor. Our new technique can help make better use of large-scale cursor data in identifying how users examine Web search pages.},

The data also show that there are regular patterns of eye/mouse movements. Based on these findings, we argue that a mouse could provide us more information than just the x, y position where a user is pointing. This implies that we can use an inexpensive and extremely popular tool as an alternative of eye-tracking systems, especially in web usability evaluation. Moreover, by understanding the intent of every mouse movement, we may be able to achieve a better interface for human computer interaction.},

The proposed algorithm is simple, efficient, and yields full resolution saliency maps.

At which neuronal stage they interact to guide behavior is still unknown. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we found evidence for a hierarchy of saliency maps in human early visual cortex (V1 to hV4) and identified where bottom-up saliency interacts with top-down control: V1 represented pure bottom-up signals, V2 was only responsive to top-down modulations, and in hV4 bottom-up saliency and top-down control converged. Two distinct cerebral networks exerted top-down control: distractor suppression engaged the left intraparietal sulcus, while target enhancement involved the frontal eye field and lateral occipital cortex. Hence, attentional selection is implemented in integrated maps in visual cortex, which provide precise topographic information about target-distractor locations thus allowing for successful visual search.},

  abstract = {The predictions of 13 computational bottom-up saliency models and a newly introduced Multiscale Contrast Conspicuity (MCC) metric are compared with human visual conspicuity measurements. The agreement between human visual conspicuity estimates and model saliency predictions is quantified through their rank order correlation. The maximum of the computational saliency value over the target support area correlates most strongly with visual conspicuity for 12 of the 13 models. A simple multiscale contrast model and the MCC metric both yield the largest correlation with human visual target conspicuity (\{\&\#x003E;\}0.84). Local image saliency largely determines human visual inspection and interpretation of static and dynamic scenes. Computational saliency models therefore have a wide range of important applications, like adaptive content delivery, region-of-interest-based image compression, video summarization, progressive image transmission, image segmentation, image quality assessment, object recognition, and content-aware image scaling. However, current bottom-up saliency models do not incorporate important visual effects like crowding and lateral interaction. Additional knowledge about the exact nature of the interactions between the mechanisms mediating human visual saliency is required to develop these models further. The MCC metric and its associated psychophysical saliency measurement procedure are useful tools to systematically investigate the relative contribution of different feature dimensions to overall visual target saliency.},

  abstract = {Most models of visual search, whether involving overt eye movements or covert shifts of attention, are based on the concept of a saliency map, that is, an explicit two-dimensional map that encodes the saliency or conspicuity of objects in the visual environment. Competition among neurons in this map gives rise to a single winning location that corresponds to the next attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically allows the system to attend to the next most salient location. We describe a detailed computer implementation of such a scheme, focusing on the problem of combining information across modalities, here orientation, intensity and color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied to common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very demanding visual search task. Its successful performance is used to address the extent to which the primate visual system carries out visual search via one or more such saliency maps and how this can be tested.

Unfortunately, a large proportion of patients offered oxaliplatin fail to benefit from it. In the era of personalized treatment, there are strong efforts to identify biomarkers that will predict efficacy to oxaliplatin-based treatments. Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is a key element in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing DNA adducts induced by platinum compounds. ERCC1 has recently been shown to be closely associated with outcome in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC): both high ERCC1 protein and gene expression are associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and better outcome without treatment. Therefore, ERCC1 has the potential to be used as a strong candidate biomarker, both predictive and prognostic, for colorectal cancer. This review will focus on the preclinical and clinical evidences supporting ERCC1 as a major molecule in oxaliplatin resistance. In addition, the important technologies used to assess ERCC1 gene and protein expression will be highlighted. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Computational prediction of protein mutation impacts offers a fast, economical and potentially accurate alternative to laboratory mutagenesis. Most existing methods rely on geometric descriptions, this work introduces a topology based approach to provide an entirely new representation of protein mutation impacts that could not be obtained from conventional techniques. Results: Topology based mutation predictor (T-MP) is introduced to dramatically reduce the geometric complexity and number of degrees of freedom of proteins, while element specific persistent homology is proposed to retain essential biological information. The present approach is found to outperform other existing methods in globular protein mutation impact predictions. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82 with an RMSE of 0.92 kcal/mol is obtained on a test set of 350 mutation samples. For the prediction of membrane protein stability changes upon mutation, the proposed topological approach has a 84\% higher Pearson correlation coefficient than the current state-of-the-art empirical methods, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.57 and an RMSE of 1.09 kcal/mol in a 5-fold cross validation on a set of 223 membrane protein mutation samples.},

MOFA automatically discovered the known dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) status and trisomy of chromosome 12, as well as previously underappreciated drivers of variation, such as response to oxidative stress. These factors capture key dimensions of patient heterogeneity, including those linked to clinical outcomes.

However, when theoretical routes are intractable, in this electronic age, the sampling distributions can be reasonably approximated using empirical methods. The point is illustrated using the null distribution of Hoeffding's test of bivariate independence which is important because of its consistency against all dependence alternatives. For constructing the approximations we employ two Weibull extensions, the generalized Weibull and the exponentiated Weibull families, which contain a rich variety of density shapes and tail lengths, and have their distribution functions and quantile functions available in closed form, making them convenient for obtaining the necessary percentiles and p-values. Both approximations are seen to be excellent in terms of accuracy, but that based on the generalized Weibull is more portable. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Most molecular cancer therapies act on protein targets but data on the proteome status of patients and cellular models for proteome-guided pre-clinical drug sensitivity studies are only beginning to emerge. Here, we profiled the proteomes of 65 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines to a depth of {$>$} 10,000 proteins using mass spectrometry. Integration with proteomes of 90 CRC patients and matched transcriptomics data defined integrated CRC subtypes, highlighting cell lines representative of each tumour subtype. Modelling the responses of 52 CRC cell lines to 577 drugs as a function of proteome profiles enabled predicting drug sensitivity for cell lines and patients. Among many novel associations, MERTK was identified as a predictive marker for resistance towards MEK1/2 inhibitors and immunohistochemistry of 1,074 CRC tumours confirmed MERTK as a prognostic survival marker. We provide the proteomic and pharmacological data as a resource to the community to, for example, facilitate the design of innovative prospective clinical trials.},

  abstract = {There has been intense effort over the past couple of decades to identify loci underlying quantitative traits as a key step in the process of elucidating the etiology of complex diseases. Recently there has been some effort to coalesce non-biased high-throughput data, e.g. high density genotyping and genome wide RNA expression, to drive understanding of the molecular basis of disease. However, a stumbling block has been the difficult question of how to leverage this information to identify molecular mechanisms that explain quantitative trait loci (QTL). We have developed a formal statistical hypothesis test, resulting in a p-value, to quantify uncertainty in a causal inference pertaining to a measured factor, e.g. a molecular species, which potentially mediates a known causal association between a locus and a quantitative trait. We treat the causal inference as a 'chain' of mathematical conditions that must be satisfied to conclude that the potential mediator is causal for the trait, where the inference is only as good as the weakest link in the chain. P-values are computed for the component conditions, which include tests of linkage and conditional independence. The Intersection-Union Test, in which a series of statistical tests are combined to form an omnibus test, is then employed to generate the overall test result. Using computer simulated mouse crosses, we show that type I error is low under a variety of conditions that include hidden variables and reactive pathways. We show that power under a simple causal model is comparable to other model selection techniques as well as Bayesian network reconstruction methods. We further show empirically that this method compares favorably to Bayesian network reconstruction methods for reconstructing transcriptional regulatory networks in yeast, recovering 7 out of 8 experimentally validated regulators. Here we propose a novel statistical framework in which existing notions of causal mediation are formalized into a hypothesis test, thus providing a standard quantitative measure of uncertainty in the form of a p-value. The method is theoretically and computationally accessible and with the provided software may prove a useful tool in disentangling molecular relationships.},

However, understanding brain function, development, and disease will require linking molecular cell types to morphological, physiological, and behavioral correlates.

Prior studies have indicated that this negative regulation by protein kinase C involves the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation of serine 612 in IRS-1. In the present studies, the negative regulation by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was compared with that induced by endothelin-1, an activator of protein kinase C. In contrast to endothelin-1, the inhibitory effects of PDGF did not require mitogen-activated protein kinase or the phosphorylation of serine 612. Instead, three other serines in the phosphorylation domain of IRS-1 (serines 632, 662, and 731) were required for the negative regulation by PDGF. In addition, the PDGF-activated serine/threonine kinase called Akt was found to inhibit insulin signaling. Moreover, this inhibition required the same IRS-1 serine residues as the inhibition by PDGF. Finally, the negative regulatory effects of PDGF and Akt were inhibited by rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), one of the downstream targets of Akt. These studies implicate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase cascade as an additional negative regulatory pathway for the insulin signaling cascade.},

Expression of other isoforms such as PMCA4 may influence mammary gland epithelial cell proliferation and aberrant regulation of PMCA isoform expression may lead or contribute to mammary gland pathophysiology in the form of breast cancers. To explore whether PMCA2 and PMCA4 expression may be deregulated in breast cancer, we compared mRNA expression of these PMCA isoforms in tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell lines using real time RT-PCR. PMCA2 mRNA has a higher level of expression in some breast cancer cell lines and is overexpressed more than 100-fold in ZR-75-1 cells, compared to non-tumorigenic 184B5 cells. Although differences in PMCA4 mRNA levels were observed between breast cell lines, they were not of the magnitude observed for PMCA2. We conclude that PMCA2 mRNA can be highly overexpressed in some breast cancer cells. The significance of PMCA2 overexpression on tumorigenicity and its possible correlation with other properties such as invasiveness requires further study.},

We illustrated the differential organization principles of nucleosomes surrounding transcription start site for silently- and actively-transcribed genes, at the single-cell level and in the long-range scale. The heterogeneous patterns of chromatin statuses spanning multiple genes were phased. Together with single-cell RNA-seq data, we quantitatively revealed how chromatin accessibility correlated with gene transcription positively in a highly-heterogeneous scenario. Moreover, we quantified the openness of promoters and investigated the coupled chromatin changes of adjacent genes at single DNA molecules during transcription reprogramming.},

  abstract = {Spatial gene expression patterns enable the detection of local covariability and are extremely useful for identifying local gene interactions during normal development. The abundance of spatial expression data in recent years has led to the modeling and analysis of regulatory networks. The inherent complexity of such data makes it a challenge to extract biological information. We developed staNMF, a method that combines a scalable implementation of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with a new stability-driven model selection criterion. When applied to a set ofDrosophilaearly embryonic spatial gene expression images, one of the largest datasets of its kind, staNMF identified 21 principal patterns (PP). Providing a compact yet biologically interpretable representation ofDrosophilaexpression patterns, PP are comparable to a fate map generated experimentally by laser ablation and show exceptional promise as a data-driven alternative to manual annotations. Our analysis mapped genes to cell-fate programs and assigned putative biological roles to uncharacterized genes. Finally, we used the PP to generate local transcription factor regulatory networks. Spatially local correlation networks were constructed for six PP that span along the embryonic anterior-posterior axis. Using a two-tail 5\% cutoff on correlation, we reproduced 10 of the 11 links in the well-studied gap gene network. The performance of PP with theDrosophiladata suggests that staNMF provides informative decompositions and constitutes a useful computational lens through which to extract biological insight from complex and often noisy gene expression data.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are often deemed too computationally intensive to be of any practical use for big data applications, and in particular for inference on datasets containing a large number \$n\$ of individual data points, also known as tall datasets. In scenarios where data are assumed independent, various approaches to scale up the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in a Bayesian inference context have been recently proposed in machine learning and computational statistics. These approaches can be grouped into two categories: divide-and-conquer approaches and, subsampling-based algorithms. The aims of this article are as follows. First, we present a comprehensive review of the existing literature, commenting on the underlying assumptions and theoretical guarantees of each method. Second, by leveraging our understanding of these limitations, we propose an original subsampling-based approach which samples from a distribution provably close to the posterior distribution of interest, yet can require less than \$O(n)\$ data point likelihood evaluations at each iteration for certain statistical models in favourable scenarios. Finally, we have only been able so far to propose subsampling-based methods which display good performance in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation of the target posterior distribution is excellent. It remains an open challenge to develop such methods in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation is poor.},

  doi = {10.1148/81.2.288},
  abstract = {At the present time, the information contained in a roentgenogram can be extracted only by a radiologist observing it. That this link can sometimes fail has recently been emphasized by Tuddenham (1) and Garland (2), who have reported frequent perceptual errors by radiologists viewing roentgenograms demonstrating fairly obvious lesions. Such errors have also been shown by Zeidner and Sadacca (3) and Enoch (4) in their studies of photointerpreters reading aerial photographs. There are two stages in the visual perception of detail. First, the object must be focused upon the fovea; second, this focused image must be translated into meaning by the observer's brain. The fovea subtends an angle of only 2\textdegree, so that at 30 inches the area of distinct vision is a circle about 1 inch in diameter. Thus, some 300 separate eye fixations are necessary to cover the area presented by a 14 ? 17-inch roentgenogram at this distance. The eye searches the film by moving in small rapid jumps of high velocity (saccadic movements), stopping at intervals and remaining steady before making another jump. It is only during these steady intervals or fixations that we are able to see clearly, for while the eye is moving there is no perception of detail. During any visual task an observer makes many unconscious eye movements and fixations. The eyes receive and transmit to the brain a vast amount of information, several million ?bits? a second, to use the language of communication theory, but the brain can make decisions at a rate equivalent to only about 25 bits a second. Therefore, some selective mechanism must exist controlling the information which rises to conscious levels. Experience and training must be among the factors affecting this selective mechanism, and knowledge of the methods of visual search adopted by the radiologist is necessary if the causes of his perceptual errors are to be discerned. Method The present study is based upon the initial visual search of five radiologists entering training, who viewed six roentgenograms and three projected Rorschach ink blots for thirty seconds each, while their eye movements were recorded by an optical eye-marker camera. The film records were then analyzed for search patterns, fixation times, and distribution of fixations. Rorschach slides were introduced both as a ?control? presentation and as part of a larger study. Viewing was done at a distance of 42 inches because of equipment limitations, although Tuddenham and Enoch have pointed out that the ideal display for initial search subtends an angle of 9\textdegree{} at the eye, which would then place a conventional chest film 8 ft. from the viewer. ?Normal? chest films were used in this first study because it was desired to examine the initial search patterns, and these would be disturbed if any abnormalities became apparent.},

  abstract = {A core skill in diagnostic pathology is light microscopy. Remarkably little is known about human factors that affect the proficiency of pathologists as light microscopists. The cognitive skills of pathologists have received relatively little attention in comparison with the large literature on human performance studies in radiology. One reason for this lack of formal visual search studies in pathology has been the physical restrictions imposed by the close positioning of a microscope operator's head to the microscope's eyepieces. This blocks access to the operator's eyes and precludes assessment of the microscopist's eye movements. Virtual slide microscopy now removes this barrier and opens the door for studies on human factors and visual search strategies in light microscopy. The aim of this study was to assess eye movements of medical students, pathology residents, and practicing pathologists examining virtual slides on a digital display monitor. Whole histopathology glass slide digital images, so-called virtual slides, of 20 consecutive breast core biopsy cases were used in a retrospective study. These high-quality virtual slides were produced with an array-microscope equipped DMetrix DX-40 ultrarapid virtual slide processor (DMetrix, Tucson, Ariz). Using an eye-tracking device, we demonstrated for the first time that when a virtual slide reader initially looks at a virtual slide his or her eyes are very quickly attracted to regions of interest (ROIs) within the slide and that these ROIs are likely to contain diagnostic information. In a matter of seconds, critical decisions are made on the selection of ROIs for further examination at higher magnification. We recorded: (1) the time virtual slide readers spent fixating on self-selected locations on the video monitor; (2) the characteristics of the ways the eyes jumped between fixation locations; and (3) x and y coordinates for each virtual slide marking the sites the virtual slide readers manually selected for zooming to higher ROI magnifications. We correlated the locations of the visually selected fixation locations and the manually selected ROIs. Viewing profiles were identified for each group. Fully trained pathologists spent significantly less time (mean, 4.471 seconds) scanning virtual slides when compared to pathology residents (mean, 7.148 seconds) or medical students (mean, 11.861 seconds), but had relatively prolonged saccadic eye movements (P {$<$} .0001). Saccadic eye movements are defined as eye movements between fixation locations. On the other hand, the pathologists spent significantly more time than trainees dwelling on the 3 locations they subsequently chose for zooming. Unlike either the medical students or the residents, the pathologists frequently choose areas for viewing at higher magnification outside of areas of foveal (central) vision. Eye movement studies of scanning pathways (scan paths) may be useful for developing eye movement profiles for individuals and for understanding the difference in performances between novices and experts. They may also be useful for developing new visual search strategies for rendering diagnoses on telepathology virtual slides. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Forced expression of SETDB1 in NSCLC cell lines enhanced their clonogenic growth in vitro and markedly increased tumor size in a murine xenograft model; while silencing (shRNA) SETDB1 in NSCLC cells slowed their proliferation. SETDB1 positively stimulated activity of the WNT/{$\beta$}-catenin pathway and diminished P53 expression resulting in enhanced NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo.

Uncovering and quantifying pathology visual and nonvisual diagnostic patterns have great potential to improve clinical outcomes and avoid diagnostic pitfalls. METHODS:: Here, we present PathEdEx, an informatics computational framework that incorporates whole-slide digital pathology imaging with multiscale gaze-tracking technology to create web-based interactive pathology educational atlases and to datamine visual and nonvisual diagnostic heuristics. RESULTS:: We demonstrate the capabilities of PathEdEx for mining visual and nonvisual diagnostic heuristics using the first PathEdEx volume of a hematopathology atlas. We conducted a quantitative study on the time dynamics of zooming and panning operations utilized by experts and novices to come to the correct diagnosis. We then performed association rule mining to determine sets of diagnostic factors that consistently result in a correct diagnosis, and studied differences in diagnostic strategies across different levels of pathology expertise using Markov chain (MC) modeling and MC Monte Carlo simulations. To perform these studies, we translated raw gaze points to high-explanatory semantic labels that represent pathology diagnostic clues. Therefore, the outcome of these studies is readily transformed into narrative descriptors for direct use in pathology education and practice. CONCLUSION:: PathEdEx framework can be used to capture best practices of pathology visual and nonvisual diagnostic heuristics that can be passed over to the next generation of pathologists and have potential to streamline implementation of precision diagnostics in precision medicine settings.},

  abstract = {Modern digital pathology departments have grown to produce whole-slide image data at petabyte scale, an unprecedented treasure chest for medical machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, most digital slides are not annotated at the image level, hindering large-scale application of supervised learning. Manual labeling is prohibitive, requiring pathologists with decades of training and outstanding clinical service responsibilities. This problem is further aggravated by the United States Food and Drug Administration's ruling that primary diagnosis must come from a glass slide rather than a digital image. We present the first end-to-end framework to overcome this problem, gathering annotations in a nonintrusive manner during a pathologist's routine clinical work: (i) microscope-specific 3D-printed commodity camera mounts are used to video record the glass-slide-based clinical diagnosis process; (ii) after routine scanning of the whole slide, the video frames are registered to the digital slide; (iii) motion and observation time are estimated to generate a spatial and temporal saliency map of the whole slide. Demonstrating the utility of these annotations, we train a convolutional neural network that detects diagnosis-relevant salient regions, then report accuracy of 85.15\% in bladder and 91.40\% in prostate, with 75.00\% accuracy when training on prostate but predicting in bladder, despite different pathologists examining the different tissues. When training on one patient but testing on another, AUROC in bladder is 0.79~{$\pm{}~$}0.11 and in prostate is 0.96~{$\pm{}~$}0.04.

We use these extracted regions in a visual bag-of-words model based on color and texture features to predict diagnostically relevant ROIs on whole slide images. Using a logistic regression classifier in a cross-validation setting on 240 digital breast biopsy slides and viewport tracking logs of three expert pathologists, we produce probability maps that show 74 \% overlap with the actual regions at which pathologists looked. We compare different bag-of-words models by changing dictionary size, visual word definition (patches vs. superpixels), and training data (automatically extracted ROIs vs. manually marked ROIs). This study is a first step in understanding the scanning behaviors of pathologists and the underlying reasons for diagnostic errors.},

A web-based viewer recorded pathologists' behaviors while interpreting a subset of 60 randomly selected and randomly ordered slides. To characterize diagnostic search patterns, we used the viewport location, time stamp, and zoom level data to calculate four variables: average zoom level, maximum zoom level, zoom level variance, and scanning percentage. Two distinct search strategies were confirmed: scanning is characterized by panning at a constant zoom level, while drilling involves zooming in and out at various locations. Statistical analysis was applied to examine the associations of different visual interpretive strategies with pathologist characteristics, diagnostic accuracy, and efficiency. We found that females scanned more than males, and age was positively correlated with scanning percentage, while the facility size was negatively correlated. Throughout 60 cases, the scanning percentage and total interpretation time per slide decreased, and these two variables were positively correlated. The scanning percentage was not predictive of diagnostic accuracy. Increasing average zoom level, maximum zoom level, and zoom variance were correlated with over-interpretation.},

  doi = {10.13189/ujer.2016.040609},
  abstract = {Learning the meaningful use of the microscope is an essential requirement in school curricula. Modern science and medicine is hardly conceivable without the inclusion of microscopy. The number of didactic studies in this area, however, is negligible. Real microscopy is rarely used to gain knowledge in higher school years. Could the understanding of cell concept and the skills to interpret histological structures be complemented and supported by digital microscopy? The current study investigates this problem in two methodological ways. First, learning effects of modules with interactive whiteboards (IWB) are compared with original microscopy (2012: n=70; 2013: 25+14; 2013/14: n=21+27; 2014: n=40) using the example of human biology with pre-service student teachers. The instruments were questionnaires (short scale of intrinsic motivation, flow, and knowledge test) and interviews. Second, eye movements of 12th grade students were measured during histological image processing of retina and nervous tissue in the student laboratory of neuroscience in Tubingen (High Quality Tower mounted eye tracking) (2013: n=11+26; 2014: n=28). We measured that fixation in the area of interest (AoI) corresponded with the level of prior knowledge. The estimation of instructional aids (e.g. schematic representation) while viewing demanding histological images also depends on prior knowledge. The same applies to the IWB. The use of the whiteboard is valued because of the possibility to make visible connections and put these in contexts. The use of the whiteboard does not, however, surpass the motivation and flow of real microscopy in problem-oriented learning processes. The IWB is a good supplement but is not a substitute for the microscope.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Digital slides obtained from whole slide imaging (WSI) platforms are typically viewed in two dimensions using desktop personal computer monitors or more recently on mobile devices. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any studies viewing digital pathology slides in a virtual reality (VR) environment. VR technology enables users to be artificially immersed in and interact with a computer-simulated world. Oculus Rift is among the world's first consumer-targeted VR headsets, intended primarily for enhanced gaming. Our aim was to explore the use of the Oculus Rift for examining digital pathology slides in a VR environment. METHODS:: An Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2) was connected to a 64-bit computer running Virtual Desktop software. Glass slides from twenty randomly selected lymph node cases (ten with benign and ten malignant diagnoses) were digitized using a WSI scanner. Three pathologists reviewed these digital slides on a 27-inch 5K display and with the Oculus Rift after a 2-week washout period. Recorded endpoints included concordance of final diagnoses and time required to examine slides. The pathologists also rated their ease of navigation, image quality, and diagnostic confidence for both modalities. RESULTS:: There was 90\% diagnostic concordance when reviewing WSI using a 5K display and Oculus Rift. The time required to examine digital pathology slides on the 5K display averaged 39 s (range 10\textendash{}120 s), compared to 62 s with the Oculus Rift (range 15\textendash{}270 s). All pathologists confirmed that digital pathology slides were easily viewable in a VR environment. The ratings for image quality and diagnostic confidence were higher when using the 5K display. CONCLUSION:: Using the Oculus Rift DK2 to view and navigate pathology whole slide images in a virtual environment is feasible for diagnostic purposes. However, image resolution using the Oculus Rift device was limited. Interactive VR technologies such as the Oculus Rift are novel tools that may be of use in digital pathology.},

These errors are particularly common near the ends of sequences and pose a challenge for genotype calling. Results: I describe an expectation-maximization algorithm that estimates genotype frequencies and errors along sequences to allow for accurate genotype calling from ancient sequences. The implementation of this method, called snpAD, performs well on high-coverage ancient data, as shown by simulations and by subsampling the data of a high-coverage Neandertal genome. Although estimates for low-coverage genomes are less accurate, I am able to derive approximate estimates of heterozygosity from several low-coverage Neandertals. These estimates show that low heterozygosity, compared to modern humans, was common among Neandertals.},

  doi = {10.1186/s12859-018-2455-0},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND Because driver mutations provide selective advantage to the mutant clone, they tend to occur at a higher frequency in tumor samples compared to selectively neutral (passenger) mutations. However, mutation frequency alone is insufficient to identify cancer genes because mutability is influenced by many gene characteristics, such as size, nucleotide composition, etc. The goal of this study was to identify gene characteristics associated with the frequency of somatic mutations in the gene in tumor samples. RESULTS We used data on somatic mutations detected by genome wide screens from the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC). Gene size, nucleotide composition, expression level of the gene, relative replication time in the cell cycle, level of evolutionary conservation and other gene characteristics (totaling 11) were used as predictors of the number of somatic mutations. We applied stepwise multiple linear regression to predict the number of mutations per gene. Because missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations are associated with different sets of gene characteristics, they were modeled separately. Gene characteristics explain 88\% of the variation in the number of missense, 40\% of nonsense, and 23\% of frameshift mutations. Comparisons of the observed and expected numbers of mutations identified genes with a higher than expected number of mutations- positive outliers. Many of these are known driver genes. A number of novel candidate driver genes was also identified. CONCLUSIONS By comparing the observed and predicted number of mutations in a gene, we have identified known cancer-associated genes as well as 111 novel cancer associated genes. We also showed that adding the number of silent mutations per gene reported by genome/exome wide screens across all cancer type (COSMIC data) as a predictor substantially exceeds predicting accuracy of the most popular cancer gene predicting tool - MutsigCV.},

A promising approach to solve this problem is embarrassingly parallel MCMC (EP-MCMC), which first partitions the data into multiple subsets and runs independent sampling algorithms on each subset. The subset posterior draws are then aggregated via some combining rules to obtain the final approximation. Existing EP-MCMC algorithms are limited by approximation accuracy and difficulty in resampling. In this article, we propose a new EP-MCMC algorithm PART that solves these problems. The new algorithm applies random partition trees to combine the subset posterior draws, which is distribution-free, easy to resample from and can adapt to multiple scales.

Bayesian methods quantify uncertainty through posterior and predictive distributions, but it is difficult to rapidly estimate summaries of these distributions, such as quantiles and intervals. Variational Bayes approximations are widely used, but may badly underestimate posterior covariance. Typically, the focus of Bayesian inference is on point and interval estimates for one-dimensional functionals of interest. In small scale problems, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms remain the gold standard, but such algorithms face major problems in scaling up to big data. Various modifications have been proposed based on parallelization and approximations based on subsamples, but such approaches are either highly complex or lack theoretical support and/or good performance outside of narrow settings. We propose a very simple and general posterior interval estimation algorithm, which is based on running Markov chain Monte Carlo in parallel for subsets of the data and averaging quantiles estimated from each subset.

These methods divide the data into smaller subsets, sample from the posterior distribution of parameters in parallel on all the subsets, and combine posterior samples from all the subsets to approximate the full data posterior distribution. The smaller size of any subset compared to the full data implies that posterior sampling on any subset is computationally more efficient than sampling from the true posterior distribution. Since the combination step takes negligible time relative to sampling, posterior computations can be scaled to massive data by dividing the full data into a sufficiently large number of data subsets. One such approach relies on the geometry of posterior distributions estimated across different subsets and combines them through their barycenter in a Wasserstein space of probability measures. We provide theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of approximation that are valid in many applications. We show that the geometric method approximates the full data posterior distribution better than its competitors across diverse simulations and reproduces known results when applied to a movie ratings database.},

The WASP approach allows posterior sampling algorithms for smaller data sets to be trivially scaled to huge data.

  abstract = {With the routine collection of massive-dimensional predictors in many application areas, screening methods that rapidly identify a small subset of promising predictors have become commonplace. We propose a new MOdular Bayes Screening (MOBS) approach, which involves several novel characteristics that can potentially lead to improved performance. MOBS first applies a Bayesian mixture model to the marginal distribution of the response, obtaining posterior samples of mixture weights, cluster-specific parameters, and cluster allocations for each subject. Hypothesis tests are then introduced, corresponding to whether or not to include a given predictor, with posterior probabilities for each hypothesis available analytically conditionally on unknowns sampled in the first stage and tuning parameters controlling borrowing of information across tests. By marginalizing over the first stage posterior samples, we avoid under-estimation of uncertainty typical of two-stage methods. We greatly simplify the model specification and reduce computational complexity by using \{\textbackslash{}em modularization\}. We provide basic theoretical support for this approach, and illustrate excellent performance relative to competitors in simulation studies and the ability to capture complex shifts beyond simple differences in means. The method is illustrated with applications to genomics by using a very high-dimensional cis-eQTL dataset with roughly 38 million SNPs.},

  abstract = {Gaussian scale mixture priors are frequently employed in Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional models, and several members of this family have optimal risk properties when the truth is sparse. While optimization-based algorithms for the extremely popular Lasso and elastic net procedures can scale to dimension in the hundreds of thousands, corresponding Bayesian methods that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for computation are limited to problems at least an order of magnitude smaller. This is due to high computational cost per step of the associated Markov kernel and growth of the variance of time-averaging estimators as a function of dimension. We propose an MCMC algorithm for computation in these models that combines block updating and approximations of the Markov kernel to directly combat both of these factors. Our algorithm gives orders of magnitude speedup over the best existing alternatives in high-dimensional applications. We give theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of the kernel approximation. The scalability of the algorithm is illustrated in simulations with problem size as large as \$N=5,000\$ observations and \$p=50,000\$ predictors, and an application to a genome wide association study with \$N=2,267\$ and \$p=98,385\$. The empirical results also show that the new algorithm yields estimates with lower mean squared error, intervals with better coverage, and elucidates features of the posterior that were often missed by previous algorithms in high dimensions, including bimodality of posterior marginals indicating uncertainty about which covariates belong in the model. This latter feature is an important motivation for a Bayesian approach to testing and selection in high dimensions.},

  abstract = {Broadly speaking, nineteenth century statistics was Bayesian, while the twentieth century was frequentist, at least from the point of view of most scientific practitioners. Here in the twenty-first century scientists are bringing statisticians much bigger problems to solve, often comprising millions of data points and thousands of parameters. Which statistical philosophy will dominate practice? My guess, backed up with some recent examples, is that a combination of Bayesian and frequentist ideas will be needed to deal with our increasingly intense scientific environment. This will be a challenging period for statisticians, both applied and theoretical, but it also opens the opportunity for a new golden age, rivaling that of Fisher, Neyman, and the other giants of the early 1900s. What follows is the text of the 164th ASA presidential address, delivered at the awards ceremony in Toronto on August 10, 2004. Two Septembers ago, there was a conference of particle physicists and statisticians at Stanford, called phystat2003. I gave a talk at phystat2003 titled " Bayesians, Frequentists, and Physicists. " Earlier that year I'd spoken to a meeting of bio-medical researchers at the " Hutch " in Seattle, under the title " Bayesians, Frequentists, and Microbiologists. " These weren't the same lectures, and both were different than tonight's talk, but you can see that I've gotten stuck on a naming scheme. You might worry that this has gotten out of hand, and next week it might be almost anything else that ends in " ists. " But no, there is a plan here: The common theme I've been stuck on, and what I want to talk about tonight, is the impact of statistics on modern science and also the impact of modern science on statistics. Statisticians, by the nature of our profession, tend to be crit-ical thinkers, and that includes a big dose of self-criticism. It is easy to think of statistics as a small struggling field, but that's not at all what the historical record shows. Starting from just about zero in 1900, statistics has grown steadily in numbers and, more importantly, in intellectual influence. The growth process has accelerated in the past few decades as science has moved into areas where random noise is endemic and efficient inference is crucial. It's hard to imagine phystat1903, back when physicists scorned statistical methods as appropriate only for soft noisy fields like the social sciences. But physicists have their own problems with noise these days, as they try to answer questions where data are really thin on the ground. The example of great-est interest at phystat2003 concerned the mass of the neutrino, a famously elusive particle that is much lighter than an electron and may weigh almost nothing at all. The physicists' trouble was that the best unbiased estimate of the neutrino mass was negative, about -1 on a scale with unit standard error. The mass itself can't be negative of course, and these days they're pretty sure it's not zero. They wished to establish an upper bound for the mass, the smaller the better from the point of view of further experimentation. As a result, the particle physics literature now contains a healthy debate on Bayesian versus frequentist ways of setting the bound. The current favorite is a likelihood ratio-based system of one-sided confidence intervals. The physicists I talked with were really bothered by our 250-year-old Bayesian\textendash{}frequentist argument. Basically, there's only one way of doing physics, but there seems to be at least two ways to do statistics, and they don't always give the same B.

Here, we introduce cell "hashing", where oligo-tagged antibodies against ubiquitously expressed surface proteins are used to uniquely label cells from distinct samples, which can be subsequently pooled. By sequencing these tags alongside the cellular transcriptome, we can assign each cell to its sample of origin, and robustly identify doublets originating from multiple samples. We demonstrate our approach by pooling eight human PBMC samples on a single run of the 10x Chromium system, substantially reducing our per-cell costs for library generation. Cell "hashing" is inspired by, and complementary to, elegant multiplexing strategies based on genetic variation, which we also leverage to validate our results. We therefore envision that our approach will help to generalize the benefits of single cell multiplexing to diverse samples and experimental designs.},

  doi = {10.1101/424192},
  abstract = {Quantification of gene expression levels at the single cell level has revealed that gene expression can vary substantially even across a population of homogeneous cells. However, it is currently unclear what genomic features control variation in gene expression levels, and whether common genetic variants may impact gene expression variation. Here, we take a genome-wide approach to identify expression variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs). To this end, we generated single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from 53 Yoruba individuals. We collected data for a median of 95 cells per individual and a total of 5,447 single cells, and identified 241 mean expression QTLs (eQTLs) at 10\% FDR, of which 82\% replicate in bulk RNA-seq data from the same individuals. We further identified 14 vQTLs at 10\% FDR, but demonstrate that these can also be explained as effects on mean expression. Our study suggests that dispersion QTLs (dQTLs) which could alter the variance of expression independently of the mean can have larger fold changes, but explain less phenotypic variance than eQTLs. We estimate 424 individuals as a lower bound to achieve 80\% power to detect the strongest dQTLs in iPSCs. These results will guide the design of future studies on understanding the genetic control of gene expression variance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new deterministic approximation technique in Bayesian networks. This method, "Expectation Propagation," unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation , because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, vari-ational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers.},

We provide evidence that many heritable variations in gene function--such as burst size, burst frequency, cell cycle-specific expression and expression correlation/noise between cells--are masked when expression is averaged over many cells. Our results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1611835114},
  abstract = {Deep neural networks are used in many state-of-the-art systems for machine perception. Once a network is trained to do a specific task, e.g., bird classification, it cannot easily be trained to do new tasks, e.g., incrementally learning to recognize additional bird species or learning an entirely different task such as flower recognition. When new tasks are added, typical deep neural networks are prone to catastrophically forgetting previous tasks. Networks that are capable of assimilating new information incrementally, much like how humans form new memories over time, will be more efficient than re-training the model from scratch each time a new task needs to be learned. There have been multiple attempts to develop schemes that mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but these methods have not been directly compared, the tests used to evaluate them vary considerably, and these methods have only been evaluated on small-scale problems (e.g., MNIST). In this paper, we introduce new metrics and benchmarks for directly comparing five different mechanisms designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in neural networks: regularization, ensembling, rehearsal, dual-memory, and sparse-coding. Our experiments on real-world images and sounds show that the mechanism(s) that are critical for optimal performance vary based on the incremental training paradigm and type of data being used, but they all demonstrate that the catastrophic forgetting problem has yet to be solved.},

These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys' priors, are designed to support Occam's razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions.

We generalize linear response methods from statistical physics to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model variables---both for individual variables and coherently across variables. We call our method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). When the MFVB posterior approximation is in the exponential family, LRVB has a simple, analytic form, even for non-conjugate models. Indeed, we make no assumptions about the form of the true posterior. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method on a range of models for both simulated and real data.},

  abstract = {Since the early 1990s the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has utilized a panel of 60 human tumor cell lines (NCI60) representing 9 tissue types to screen for potential new anticancer agents. To date, about 100,000 compounds and 50,000 natural product extracts have been screened. Early in this program it was discovered that the pattern of growth inhibition in these cell lines was similar for compounds of similar mechanism. The development of the COMPARE algorithm provided a means by which investigators, starting with a compound of interest, could identify other compounds whose pattern of growth inhibition was similar. With extensive molecular characterization of these cell lines, COMPARE and other user-defined algorithms have been used to link patterns of molecular expression and drug sensitivity. We describe here the results of screening current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anticancer agents in the NCI60 screen, with an emphasis on those agents that target signal transduction. We analyzed results from agents with mechanisms of action presumed to be similar; we also carried out a hierarchical clustering of all of these agents. The addition of data from recently approved anticancer agents will increase the utility of the NCI60 databases to the cancer research community. These data are freely accessible to the public on the DTP website (http://dtp.cancer.gov/). The FDA-approved anticancer agents are themselves available from the NCI as a plated set of compounds for research use.},

METHODS: EyeCatcher, an eye tracking device, was used to visualise and compare the scanning patterns of five pathologists while they graded two projections of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Density cloud images were created from the scanning patterns. A questionnaire and interview provided information on the following steps in the diagnostic process. RESULTS: EyeCatcher successfully registered the scanning patterns of the pathologists. A "scanning style" and a "selective style" of visual search were distinguished. The scanning patterns, in addition to the interpretation and combination of the information ultimately leading to a diagnosis, varied between the various observers, resulting in a broad range of final diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Eye gaze tracking devices provide an excellent basis for further discussion on the interpretation and grading criteria of lesions. As such, they may play an important role in studies on diagnostic decision making in pathology and in the development of training and quality control programmes for pathologists.},

  abstract = {A pilot study examined the extent to which eye movements occurring during interpretation of digitized breast biopsy whole slide images (WSI) can distinguish novice interpreters from experts, informing assessments of competency progression during training and across the physician-learning continuum. A pathologist with fellowship training in breast pathology interpreted digital WSI of breast tissue and marked the region of highest diagnostic relevance (dROI). These same images were then evaluated using computer vision techniques to identify visually salient regions of interest (vROI) without diagnostic relevance. A non-invasive eye tracking system recorded pathologists' (N = 7) visual behavior during image interpretation, and we measured differential viewing of vROIs versus dROIs according to their level of expertise. Pathologists with relatively low expertise in interpreting breast pathology were more likely to fixate on, and subsequently return to, diagnostically irrelevant vROIs relative to experts. Repeatedly fixating on the distracting vROI showed limited value in predicting diagnostic failure. These preliminary results suggest that eye movements occurring during digital slide interpretation can characterize expertise development by demonstrating differential attraction to diagnostically relevant versus visually distracting image regions. These results carry both theoretical implications and potential for monitoring and evaluating student progress and providing automated feedback and scanning guidance in educational settings.},

The existence of the posterior distribution on the basis of a sample of point observations is not always guaranteed and a solution through set observations is implemented.

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

  title = {Parallel {{Bayesian Computation}}},
  isbn = {0-8247-4067-X},
  abstract = {The use of Bayesian inference for the analysis of complex statistical models has increased dramatically in recent years, in part due to the increasing availability of computing power. There are a range of techniques available for carrying out Bayesian inference, but the lack of analytic tractability for the vast majority of models of interest means that most of the tech-niques are numeric, and many are computationally demanding. Indeed, for high-dimensional non-linear models, the only practical methods for analysis are based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, and these are notoriously compute intensive, with some analyses requiring weeks of CPU time on powerful computers. It is clear therefore that the use of parallel computing technology in the context of Bayesian computation is of great interest to many who analyse complex models using Bayesian techniques. Section 18.2 considers the key elements of Bayesian inference, and the notion of graphical representation of the conditional independence structure underlying a statistical model. This turns out to be key to exploiting partitioning of computation in a parallel environment. Section 18.3 looks at the issues surrounding Monte Carlo simulation techniques in a parallel environment, laying the foundations for the examination of parallel MCMC in Section 18.4. Standard pseudo-random number generators are not suitable for use in a parallel setting, so this section examines the underlying reasons and the solution to the problem provided by parallel pseudo-random number generators. Parallel MCMC is the topic of Section 18.4. There are two essentially different strategies which can be used for parallelising an MCMC scheme (though these may be combined in a variety of ways). One is based on running multiple MCMC chains in parallel and the other is based on parallelisation of a single MCMC chain. There are different issues related to the different strategies, and each is appropriate in different situations. Indeed, since MCMC in complex models is somewhat of an art-form anyway, with a range of different possible algorithms and trade-offs even in the context of a non-parallel computing environment, the use of a parallel computer adds an additional layer of complexity to the MCMC algorithm design process. That is, the trade-offs one would adopt for the design of an efficient MCMC algorithm for the analysis of a given statistical algorithm in a non-parallel environment may 1 2 CHAPTER 18. PARALLEL BAYESIAN COMPUTATION well be different in a parallel setting, and could depend on the precise nature of the available parallel computing environment. Section 18.4 will attempt to give some background to the kind of trade-offs that are made in the design of an efficient MCMC algorithm, and into the reasons why one might design an algorithm differently depending on the available hardware and software. A wide range of parallel hardware is now available. Dedicated multi-processor parallel computers offer outstanding inter-processor communication speeds, but networked collec-tions of fairly ordinary PCs running a Unix-derived operating system such as Linux offer the opportunity to get super-computer performance for relatively little capital outlay. Linux " Be-owulf " clusters are rapidly becoming the de facto standard for affordable super-computing. The examples given in the later sections use a small 8-CPU Linux cluster. The cluster was formed by four dual CPU PCs together with a cheap file server linked via switched 100 Mbit network (funded by a small grant from the Royal Society). However, the principles apply also to dedicated parallel computers and to much larger Beowulf clusters using faster (Gigabit or ATM) networking infra-structure. As already mentioned, the design of algorithms will often depend to some extent on the parallel architecture. In particular, the number of processors and the speed (and latency) of inter-processor communication are of particular importance. The examples assume a homogeneous cluster (ie. all processors run at the same speed linked by a fairly uniform networking infrastructure), but are easily adapted to non-homogeneous environments. Parallel computing relies on the ability to write programs which exploit multiple proces-sors and processes and transfer information between them. Rather than developing commu-nication protocols from scratch using low level network libraries, it is far more efficient to use specially written message-passing libraries specifically designed for the development of parallel applications. The Parallel Virtual Machines (PVM) library and the Message Passing Interface (MPI) are the most popular choices. MPI is a newer more sophisticated library, and is probably a better choice for people new to parallel computing without an existing PVM code base. The small number of MPI calls necessary for the development of parallel Bayesian inference algorithms will be introduced and illustrated as they are required. Where necessary, ideas are illustrated with the description of algorithms or simple pieces of code written in ANSI 'C'. Experience of programming will be assumed, but no experience of parallel computing is required, nor is extensive knowledge of ANSI 'C'. Note that the examples adapt easily to other languages, and hence are not ANSI 'C' specific. In particular, the key software libraries used (MPI and SPRNG) both have Fortran interfaces, and hence can be used just as easily from Fortran programs. 18.2 Bayesian inference},

It has also made it possible to use eye tracking devices to explore the dynamic visual inspection and interpretation of histopathological features of tissue while pathologists review cases. Using whole slide images, the present study examined how a pathologist's diagnosis is influenced by fixed case-level factors, their prior clinical experience, and their patterns of visual inspection. Participating pathologists interpreted one of two test sets, each containing 12 digital whole slide images of breast biopsy specimens. Cases represented four diagnostic categories as determined via expert consensus: benign without atypia, atypia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive cancer. Each case included one or more regions of interest (ROIs) previously determined as of critical diagnostic importance. During pathologist interpretation we tracked eye movements, viewer tool behavior (zooming, panning), and interpretation time. Models were built using logistic and linear regression with generalized estimating equations, testing whether variables at the level of the pathologists, cases, and visual interpretive behavior would independently and/or interactively predict diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Diagnostic accuracy varied as a function of case consensus diagnosis, replicating earlier research. As would be expected, benign cases tended to elicit false positives, and atypia, DCIS, and invasive cases tended to elicit false negatives. Pathologist experience levels, case consensus diagnosis, case difficulty, eye fixation durations, and the extent to which pathologists' eyes fixated within versus outside of diagnostic ROIs, all independently or interactively predicted diagnostic accuracy. Higher zooming behavior predicted a tendency to over-interpret benign and atypia cases, but not DCIS cases. Efficiency was not predicted by pathologist- or visual search-level variables. Results provide new insights into the medical interpretive process and demonstrate the complex interactions between pathologists and cases that guide diagnostic decision-making. Implications for training, clinical practice, and computer-aided decision aids are considered.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Genomic regions without protein-coding potential give rise to millions of protein-noncoding RNA transcripts (noncoding RNA) that participate in virtually all cellular processes. Research over the last 10 yr has accumulated evidence that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are often altered in human urologic cancers.

OBJECTIVE: To review current progress in the biology and implication of lncRNAs associated with prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was searched for articles in the English language with combinations of the Medical Subject Headings terms long non coding RNA, long noncoding RNA, long untranslated RNA, cancer, neoplasms, prostate, bladder, and kidney.

EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We summarise existing knowledge on the systematics, biology, and function of lncRNAs, particularly these involved in prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer. We also discuss the possible utilisation of lncRNAs as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in urologic malignancies and portray the major challenges and future perspectives of ongoing lncRNA research.

CONCLUSIONS: LncRNAs are important regulators of gene expression interacting with the major pathways of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Alterations in the function of lncRNAs promote tumour formation, progression, and metastasis of prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. LncRNAs can be used as noninvasive tumour markers in urologic malignancies. Increased knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs perform their function in the normal and malignant cell will lead to a better understanding of tumour biology and could provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of urologic cancers.

PATIENT SUMMARY: In this paper we reviewed current knowledge of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) for the detection and treatment of urologic cancers. We conclude that lncRNAs can be used as novel biomarkers in prostate, kidney, or bladder cancer. LncRNAs hold promise as future therapeutic targets, but more research is needed to gain a better understanding of their biologic function.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are often deemed too computationally intensive to be of any practical use for big data applications, and in particular for inference on datasets containing a large number \$n\$ of individual data points, also known as tall datasets. In scenarios where data are assumed independent, various approaches to scale up the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in a Bayesian inference context have been recently proposed in machine learning and computational statistics. These approaches can be grouped into two categories: divide-and-conquer approaches and, subsampling-based algorithms. The aims of this article are as follows. First, we present a comprehensive review of the existing literature, commenting on the underlying assumptions and theoretical guarantees of each method. Second, by leveraging our understanding of these limitations, we propose an original subsampling-based approach which samples from a distribution provably close to the posterior distribution of interest, yet can require less than \$O(n)\$ data point likelihood evaluations at each iteration for certain statistical models in favourable scenarios. Finally, we have only been able so far to propose subsampling-based methods which display good performance in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation of the target posterior distribution is excellent. It remains an open challenge to develop such methods in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation is poor.},

The algorithm operates by running a separate Monte Carlo algorithm on each worker machine, which only sees a portion of the full data set. The worker-level posterior samples are then combined to form a Monte Carlo approximation to the full posterior distribution based on the complete data set. We compare several methods of carrying out the combination, including a new method based on approximating worker-level simulations using a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions. We find that resampling and kernel density based methods break down after 10 or sometimes fewer dimensions, while the new mixture-based approach works well, but the necessary mixture models take too long to fit.},

  abstract = {Expertise studies in the medical domain often focus on either visual or cognitive aspects of expertise. As a result, characteristics of expert behaviour are often described as either cognitive or visual abilities. This study focuses on both aspects of expertise and analyses them along three overarching constructs: (1) encapsulations, (2) efficiency, and (3) hypothesis testing. This study was carried out among clinical pathologists performing an authentic task: diagnosing microscopic slides. Participants were 13 clinical pathologists (experts), 12 residents in pathology (intermediates), and 13 medical students (novices). They all diagnosed seven cases in a virtual microscope and gave post hoc explanations for their diagnoses. The collected data included eye movements, microscope navigation, and verbal protocols. Results showed that experts used lower magnifications and verbalized their findings as diagnoses. Also, their diagnostic paths were more efficient, including fewer microscope movements and shorter reasoning chains. Experts entered relevant areas later in their diagnostic process, and visited fewer of them. Intermediates used relatively high magnifications and based their diagnoses on specific abnormalities. Also, they took longer to reach their diagnosis and checked more relevant areas. Novices searched in detail, described findings by their appearances, and uttered long reasoning chains. These results indicate that overarching constructs can justly be identified: encapsulations and efficiency are apparent in both visual and cognitive aspects of expertise.},

Unlike earlier approaches such as the Log-rank test, we make no assumptions as to how the data distribution might differ from the null, and our test has power against a very rich class of alternatives. In experiments, our test outperforms competing approaches for periodic and Weibull hazard functions (where risks are time dependent), and does not show the failure modes of tests that rely on user-defined features. Moreover, in cases where classical tests are provably most powerful, our test performs almost as well, while being more general.},

This presentation is problematic, as many data distributions can lead to the same bar graph, and the actual data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. To address this problem, many journals have implemented new policies that require authors to show the data distribution. This paper introduces a free, web-based tool for creating an interactive alternative to the bar graph (http://statistika.mfub.bg.ac.rs/interactive-dotplot/). This tool allows authors with no programming expertise to create customized interactive graphics, including univariate scatterplots, box plots, and violin plots, for comparing values of a continuous variable across different study groups. Individual data points may be overlaid on the graphs. Additional features facilitate visualization of subgroups or clusters of non-independent data. A second tool enables authors to create interactive graphics from data obtained with repeated independent experiments (http://statistika.mfub.bg.ac.rs/interactive-repeated-experiments-dotplot/). These tools are designed to encourage exploration and critical evaluation of the data behind the summary statistics and may be valuable for promoting transparency, reproducibility, and open science in basic biomedical research.},

We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle.

The present study was to evaluate the expression of SETDB1 in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues and cells and to preliminarily investigate the role of SETDB1 in prostate tumorigenesis in vitro. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect the expression of SETDB1 in PCa tissues, adjacent normal tissues, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, PCa cell lines and normal prostate epithelial cells. The results suggested that SETDB1 was upregulated in human PCa tissues compared with normal tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. The role of SETDB1 in proliferation was analyzed with cell counting kit-8, colony-forming efficiency and flow cytometry assays. The results indicated that downregulation of SETDB1 by siRNA inhibited PCa cell growth, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The PCa cell migration and invasion decreased by silcencing SETDB1 which were assessed by using in vitro scratch and transwell invasion assay respectively. Our data suggested that SETDB1 is overexpressed in human PCa. Silencing SETDB1 inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion.},

In an ongoing case-control study of RCC initiated in Houston, Texas, in 2002, we identified 3 empirically derived dietary patterns: "fruits and vegetables," "American/Western," and "Tex-Mex." Among 659 RCC cases and 699 controls, we evaluated associations of these dietary patterns with RCC risk and whether the associations varied by obesity status, smoking status, physical activity level, history of hypertension, and genetic variants previously identified via genome-wide association studies. Among persons in the highest categories of adherence versus the lowest, the "fruits and vegetables" dietary pattern was associated with an approximately 50\% lower RCC risk (Ptrend {$<$} 0.001), while "American/Western" dietary pattern scores were positively associated with a 2-fold higher risk (Ptrend {$<$} 0.001). We observed synergistic interaction between the American/Western pattern and hypertension status: The odds ratio (highest tertile vs. lowest) among persons with hypertension was 2.23 (95\% confidence interval: 1.43, 3.45), as compared with 1.76 (95\% confidence interval: 1.16, 2.70) among persons without hypertension (additive Pinteraction = 0.01). A variant (rs718314) in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 2 gene (ITPR2) was found to interact with the American/Western dietary pattern in relation to RCC risk (additive Pinteraction = 0.03). ITPR2 has been shown to affect nutrient metabolism and central obesity. Dietary patterns, genetic variants, and host characteristics may individually and jointly influence susceptibility to RCC.},

Integrated gene expression and genome occupancy analyses revealed GATA2 regulation of the proteasome, and IL-1-signaling, and Rho-signaling pathways. These pathways were functionally significant, as reactivation rescued viability after GATA2 depletion. In a Kras-driven NSCLC mouse model, Gata2 loss dramatically reduced tumor development. Furthermore, Gata2 deletion in established Kras mutant tumors induced striking regression. Although GATA2 itself is likely undruggable, combined suppression of GATA2-regulated pathways with clinically approved inhibitors caused marked tumor clearance. Discovery of the nononcogene addiction of KRAS mutant lung cancers to GATA2 presents a network of druggable pathways for therapeutic exploitation.},

It is also being used in resident education, in-training examinations (dermatology), and certification examinations (pathology). There are, however, few studies comparing its diagnostic accuracy and acceptability compared with traditional glass slides. This study sought to compare residents' abilities in diagnosing dermatopathology disorders in 2 image formats (traditional microscopic slides and whole mount digitized images) and to assess their perceptions of virtual microscopy in dermatopathology. Residents in dermatology and pathology training programs at 14 institutions were given a randomized combination of 20 virtual and glass slides and were asked to identify the diagnoses from multiple foils. They were then asked to give their impressions about the virtual images. Descriptive data analysis and comparison of groups using Pearson {$\chi$}2and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and Student t test for continuous variables were performed. Residents in dermatology and pathology performed similarly in diagnosing dermatopathology disorders using virtual slides or glass slides (mean [SD] correct for virtual versus glass, 5.48 (1.72) versus 5.57 (2.06); P = .70). The order of administration of virtual versus glass slides did not affect the percentage of questions answered correctly. Most residents supported the use of virtual microscopy as a learning aid, whereas fewer favored its use in testing (79\% versus 44\%, respectively). Residents performed similarly in making dermatologic diagnoses using virtual slides compared with glass slides despite the residents' preference for the latter. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Our understanding of kidney disease pathogenesis is limited by an incomplete molecular characterization of the cell types responsible for the organ's multiple homeostatic functions. To help fill this knowledge gap, we characterized 57,979 cells from healthy mouse kidneys by using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. On the basis of gene expression patterns, we infer that inherited kidney diseases that arise from distinct genetic mutations but share the same phenotypic manifestation originate from the same differentiated cell type. We also found that the collecting duct in kidneys of adult mice generates a spectrum of cell types through a newly identified transitional cell. Computational cell trajectory analysis and in vivo lineage tracing revealed that intercalated cells and principal cells undergo transitions mediated by the Notch signaling pathway. In mouse and human kidney disease, these transitions were shifted toward a principal cell fate and were associated with metabolic acidosis.},

  abstract = {CKD is the gradual, asymptomatic loss of kidney function, but current tests only identify CKD when significant loss has already happened. Several potential biomarkers of CKD have been reported, but none have been approved for preclinical or clinical use. Using RNA sequencing in a mouse model of folic acid-induced nephropathy, we identified ten genes that track kidney fibrosis development, the common pathologic finding in patients with CKD. The gene expression of all ten candidates was confirmed to be significantly higher (approximately ten-to 150-fold) in three well established, mechanistically distinct mouse models of kidney fibrosis than in models of nonfibrotic AKI. Protein expression of these genes was also high in the folic acid model and in patients with biopsy-proven kidney fibrosis. mRNA expression of the ten genes increased with increasing severity of kidney fibrosis, decreased in response to therapeutic intervention, and increased only modestly (approximately two-to five-fold) with liver fibrosis in mice and humans, demonstrating specificity for kidney fibrosis. Using targeted selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, we detected three of the ten candidates in human urine: cadherin 11 (CDH11), macrophage mannose receptor C1 (MRC1), and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). Furthermore, urinary levels of each of these three proteins distinguished patients with CKD (n=53) from healthy individuals (n=53; P,0.05). In summary, we report the identification of urinary CDH11, MRC1, and PLTP as novel noninvasive biomarkers of CKD.},

To better understand the molecular basis of renal fibrosis, we performed RNA-seq analysis in the Unilateral Ureteric Obstruction (UUO) mouse model. We analysed sham operated, 2- and 8-day post-ligation renal tissues. Thousands of genes with statistical significant changes in their expression were identified and classified into cellular processes and molecular pathways. Many novel protein-coding genes were identified, including critical transcription factors with important regulatory roles in other tissues and diseases. Emphasis was placed on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of molecular regulators of multiple and diverse cellular functions. Selected lncRNA genes were further studied and their transcriptional activity was confirmed. For three of them, their transcripts were also examined in other mouse models of nephropathies and their up- or down-regulation was found similar to the UUO model. In vitro experiments confirmed that one selected lncRNA is independent of TGF{$\beta$} or IL1b stimulation but can influence the expression of fibrosis-related proteins and the cellular phenotype. These data provide new information about the involvement of protein-coding and lncRNA genes in nephropathies, which can become novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets in the near future.},

Here we harnessed the potential of DNA and RNA sequencing in human pancreatic islets from 89 deceased donors to identify genes of potential importance in the pathogenesis of T2D. We present a catalog of genetic variants regulating gene expression (eQTL) and exon use (sQTL), including many long noncoding RNAs, which are enriched in known T2D-associated loci. Of 35 eQTL genes, whose expression differed between normoglycemic and hyperglycemic individuals, siRNA of tetraspanin 33 (TSPAN33), 5'-nucleotidase, ecto (NT5E), transmembrane emp24 protein transport domain containing 6 (TMED6), and p21 protein activated kinase 7 (PAK7) in INS1 cells resulted in reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, we provide a genome-wide catalog of allelic expression imbalance, which is also enriched in known T2D-associated loci. Notably, allelic imbalance in paternally expressed gene 3 (PEG3) was associated with its promoter methylation and T2D status. Finally, RNA editing events were less common in islets than previously suggested in other tissues. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the complexity of gene regulation in human pancreatic islets and better understanding of how genetic variation can influence glucose metabolism.},

We adapted methods from molecular evolution and applied them to 7,664 tumors across 29 cancer types.

On average, {$<$}1 coding base substitution/tumor is lost through negative selection, with purifying selection almost absent outside homozygous loss of essential genes. This allows exome-wide enumeration of all driver coding mutations, including outside known cancer genes. On average, tumors carry {$\sim$}4 coding substitutions under positive selection, ranging from {$<$}1/tumor in thyroid and testicular cancers to {$>$}10/tumor in endometrial and colorectal cancers. Half of driver substitutions occur in yet-to-be-discovered cancer genes. With increasing mutation burden, numbers of driver mutations increase, but not linearly. We systematically catalog cancer genes and show that genes vary extensively in what proportion of mutations are drivers versus passengers. Adapting an evolutionary genomics approach to cancer highlights a limited impact of negative selection on cancer genomes and significant variations in the proportion of coding driver mutations per tumor among different tumor types.},

Mechanisms of immune escape in this context are unknown. Methods We analyzed biopsy samples from paired baseline and relapsing lesions in four patients with metastatic melanoma who had had an initial objective tumor regression in response to anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab) followed by disease progression months to years later. Results Whole-exome sequencing detected clonal selection and outgrowth of the acquired resistant tumors and, in two of the four patients, revealed resistance-associated loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding interferon-receptor-associated Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) or Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), concurrent with deletion of the wild-type allele. A truncating mutation in the gene encoding the antigen-presenting protein beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) was identified in a third patient. JAK1 and JAK2 truncating mutations resulted in a lack of response to interferon gamma, including insensitivity to its antiproliferative effects on cancer cells. The B2M truncating mutation led to loss of surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I. Conclusions In this study, acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in patients with melanoma was associated with defects in the pathways involved in interferon-receptor signaling and in antigen presentation.

Here we introduce network-based stratification (NBS), a method to integrate somatic tumor genomes with gene networks. This approach allows for stratification of cancer into informative subtypes by clustering together patients with mutations in similar network regions. We demonstrate NBS in ovarian, uterine and lung cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For each tissue, NBS identifies subtypes that are predictive of clinical outcomes such as patient survival, response to therapy or tumor histology. We identify network regions characteristic of each subtype and show how mutation-derived subtypes can be used to train an mRNA expression signature, which provides similar information in the absence of DNA sequence.},

A significant amount of hydrolytic enzyme activity comes from extracellular (abiontic) activity that is bound and protected by soil colloids. This study was conducted to determine how management affects the kinetics of this enzyme (K m, substrate affinity, and V max, maximum reaction velocity) and its degree of stabilization on soil colloids. Soils were sampled from three sites in Oregon, with a paired comparison within each site of a native, unmanaged soil, and a matching soil under agricultural production ({$>$}50 years). Microwave radiation (MW) stress was used to denature the ??-glucosidase fraction associated with viable microorganisms in these soils as an estimate of abiontic activity. Total activity and V max were decreased by both management and MW. The results showed that ??-glucosidase activity is sensitive to soil management on a variety of soils and environments (135 vs. 190, 80 vs. 111 and 80 vs. 134 ??g PNP g -1 h -1 for managed and unmanaged treatments, respectively, at the three study sites in Oregon). The evidence suggests that this sensitivity to management is not (or minimally) due to differences in isoenzymes (K m generally was unaffected) but rather due to an overall reduction in the amount of enzyme present (V max decreased) and that this reduction in activity is reflected more from the activity of enzymes in the stabilized fraction than that associated with viable microbial population. Although ??-glucosidase activity after MW irradiation appears to be limited as a soil quality indicator, it maybe useful as research tool to separate abiontic from microbial activity 'biomass' ??-glucosidase activity correlated with microbial biomass C (r=0.42, P{$<$}0.05) but MW irradiated, abiontic, activity did not (r=-0.20 NS). ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The Web Services approach offers the most flexibility. However, the performance of Web Services has been a concern for many developers.

  abstract = {Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Here we report the extensive molecular characterization of 228 primary cervical cancers, one of the largest comprehensive genomic studies of cervical cancer to date. We observed notable APOBEC mutagenesis patterns and identified SHKBP1, ERBB3, CASP8, HLA-A and TGFBR2 as novel significantly mutated genes in cervical cancer. We also discovered amplifications in immune targets CD274 (also known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2), and the BCAR4 long non-coding RNA, which has been associated with response to lapatinib. Integration of human papilloma virus (HPV) was observed in all HPV18-related samples and 76\% of HPV16-related samples, and was associated with structural aberrations and increased target-gene expression. We identified a unique set of endometrial-like cervical cancers, comprised predominantly of HPV-negative tumours with relatively high frequencies of KRAS, ARID1A and PTEN mutations. Integrative clustering of 178 samples identified keratin-low squamous, keratin-high squamous and adenocarcinoma-rich subgroups. These molecular analyses reveal new potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancers.},

  abstract = {Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has become the most widely used high-throughput technology for gene expression profiling of individual cells. The potential of being able to measure cell-to-cell variability at a high-dimensional genomic scale opens numerous new lines of investigation in basic and clinical research. For example, by identifying groups of cells with expression profiles unlike those observed in cells with known phenotypes, new cell types may be discovered. Dimension reduction followed by unsupervised clustering are the quantitative approaches typically used to facilitate such discoveries. However, a challenge for this approach is that most scRNA-Seq datasets are sparse, with the percentages of measurements reported as zero ranging from 35\% to 99\% across cells, and these zeros are partially explained by experimental inefficiencies that lead to censored data. Furthermore, the observed across-cell differences in the percentages of zeros are partly due to technical artifacts rather than biological differences. Unfortunately, standard dimension reduction approaches treat these censored values as true zeros, which leads to the identification of distorted low-dimensional factors. When these factors are used for clustering, the distortion leads to incorrect identification of biological groups. Here, we propose an approach that accounts for cell-specific censoring with a varying-censoring aware matrix factor- ization (VAMF) model that permits the identification of factors in the presence of the above described systematic bias. We demonstrate the ad- vantages of our approach on published scRNA-Seq data and confirm these on simulated data.},

Ag films in the thickness range between 0.001 and 10 monolayers were deposited onto cleaved InSb(110) surfaces at T {$\approx$} 10 and T {$\approx$} 300 K. At 10 K layer-by-layer and at 300 K cluster growth occurs. The following phenomena, related to the EFposition at the Ag nInSb(110) interface, are reported for the first time: (1) deposition of 0.06 {$\pm$} 0.02 monolayers of Ag at 10 K shifts EF350 meV into the conduction band, thus forming a two-dimensional electronic channel at the interface (downward band bending); (2) heating to 300 K (after 10 K deposition) moves EFdown to the level typical for 300 K deposition; (3) for Ag deposits of more than 0.1 monolayer, EFmoves down to the conduction band minimum by further deposition at 10 K; (4) for 300 K deposition EFis almost independent of Ag coverage. We conclude that pinning of EFtakes place through surface states of different types: (1) donor-type states introduced under adsorption of individual Ag atoms at 10 K, and (2) metal-induced states introduced through metallization of the Ag deposit. \textcopyright{} 1993.},

The major role of R mutations in cancer etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on cancer genome sequencing and epidemiological data, which suggested that R mutations are responsible for two-thirds of the mutations in human cancers. All of these results are consistent with epidemiological estimates of the fraction of cancers that can be prevented by changes in the environment. Moreover, they accentuate the importance of early detection and intervention to reduce deaths from the many cancers arising from unavoidable R mutations.},

Similarity network fusion (SNF) solves this problem by constructing networks of samples (e.g., patients) for each available data type and then efficiently fusing these into one network that represents the full spectrum of underlying data. For example, to create a comprehensive view of a disease given a cohort of patients, SNF computes and fuses patient similarity networks obtained from each of their data types separately, taking advantage of the complementarity in the data. We used SNF to combine mRNA expression, DNA methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression data for five cancer data sets. SNF substantially outperforms single data type analysis and established integrative approaches when identifying cancer subtypes and is effective for predicting survival.},

In this paper, a novel approach called joint sparse principal component analysis (JSPCA) is proposed to jointly select useful features and enhance robustness to outliers. In detail, JSPCA relaxes the orthogonal constraint of transformation matrix to make it have more freedom to jointly select useful features for low-dimensional representation. JSPCA imposes joint sparse constraints on its objective function, i.e., {$\mathscr{l}$}2,1-norm is imposed on both the loss term and the regularization term, to improve the algorithmic robustness. A simple yet effective optimization solution is presented and the theoretical analyses of JSPCA are provided. The experimental results on eight data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach is feasible and effective.},

Compared with traditional supervised or semi-supervised methods, NRWRH makes full use of the tool of the network for data integration to predict drug\textendash{}target associations.

When applied to four classes of important drug\textendash{}target interactions including enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs and nuclear receptors, NRWRH significantly improves previous methods in terms of cross-validation and potential drug\textendash{}target interaction prediction.

Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists.

  abstract = {DNA is strictly compartmentalized within the nucleus to prevent autoimmunity; despite this, cyclic GMP\textendash{}AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic sensor of double-stranded DNA, is activated in autoinflammatory disorders and by DNA damage. Precisely how cellular DNA gains access to the cytoplasm remains to be determined. Here, we report that cGAS localizes to micronuclei arising from genome instability in a mouse model of monogenic autoinflammation, after exogenous DNA damage and spontaneously in human cancer cells. Such micronuclei occur after mis-segregation of DNA during cell division and consist of chromatin surrounded by its own nuclear membrane. Breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a process associated with chromothripsis, leads to rapid accumulation of cGAS, providing a mechanism by which self-DNA becomes exposed to the cytosol. cGAS is activated by chromatin, and consistent with a mitotic origin, micronuclei formation and the proinflammatory response following DNA damage are cell-cycle dependent. By combining live-cell laser microdissection with single cell transcriptomics, we establish that interferon-stimulated gene expression is induced in micronucleated cells. We therefore conclude that micronuclei represent an important source of immunostimulatory DNA. As micronuclei formed from lagging chromosomes also activate this pathway, recognition of micronuclei by cGAS may act as a cell-intrinsic immune surveillance mechanism that detects a range of neoplasia-inducing processes.},

It offers an in-between approach to the testing of the conjunction of null hypotheses against the alternative that at least one is not, and the testing of the disjunction of null hypotheses against the alternative that all hypotheses are not null. We suggest powerful test statistics for testing such a partial conjunction hypothesis that are valid under dependence between the test statistics as well as under independence. We then address the problem of testing many partial conjunction hypotheses simultaneously using the false discovery rate (FDR) approach. We prove that if the FDR controlling procedure in Benjamini and Hochberg (1995, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 57, 289-300) is used for this purpose the FDR is controlled under various dependency structures. Moreover, we can screen at all levels simultaneously in order to display the findings on a superimposed map and still control an appropriate FDR measure. We apply the method to examples from microarray analysis and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), two application areas where the need for partial conjunction analysis has been identified.},

  abstract = {Measurements of single-cell methylation are revolutionizing our understanding of epigenetic control of gene expression, yet the intrinsic data sparsity limits the scope for quantitative analysis of such data. Here, we introduce Melissa (MEthyLation Inference for Single cell Analysis), a Bayesian hierarchical method to cluster cells based on local methylation patterns, discovering patterns of epigenetic variability between cells. The clustering also acts as an effective regularization for data imputation on unassayed CpG sites, enabling transfer of information between individual cells. We show both on simulated and real data sets that Melissa provides accurate and biologically meaningful clusterings and state-of-the-art imputation performance.},
